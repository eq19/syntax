# Electrodynamics (maps)

The term of electrodynamics is referring to Quantum Electrodynamics ([QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics)) which is the [relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) of [Electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics).

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

In essence, it describes how [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) and [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) interact and is **the first theory** where full agreement between [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) and [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) is achieved.

## Basic Transformation

```note
The key components of Feynman's presentation of QED are [three basic actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-feynbook-2)

- A [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) goes from one place and time to another place and time.
- An [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) goes from one place and time to another place and time.
- An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time.

These actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of [diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram): a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_
```

QED is based on the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction.

```note
It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (P(A to B), E(C to D) and j) acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in [Feynman's book](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13930690/PhysRev.76.769.pdf)). Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.

The basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:
- If an event can occur via a number of indistinguishable alternative processes (a.k.a. "virtual" processes), then its probability amplitude is the ***sum of the probability amplitudes of the alternatives***.
- If a virtual process involves a number of independent or concomitant sub-processes, then the probability amplitude of the total (compound) process is the ***product of the probability amplitudes of the sub-processes***.

The indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is no observable feature present in the given system that in any way "reveals" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_

```note
Feynman replaces complex numbers with spinning arrows, which start at emission and end at detection of a particle.

![Feynmans_QED_probability_amplitudes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7b0132-ccc2-4372-8f4e-ca2211b7956c)

- The sum of all resulting arrows gives a final arrow whose length squared equals the probability of the event.
- In this diagram, light emitted by the source S can reach the detector at P by bouncing off the mirror (in blue) at various points.
- Each one of the paths has an arrow associated with it (whose direction changes uniformly with the time taken for the light to traverse the path).
- To correctly calculate the total probability for light to reach P starting at S, one needs to sum the arrows for all such paths.

The graph below depicts the total time spent to traverse each of the paths above.

```note
It should be remembered that the expression hides a lot of complexity. We have summed over all possible timeorderings and summed over all polarization states of the virtual photon. If we are then presented with a new Feynman diagram we don’t want to go through the full calculation again. Fortunately this isn’t necessary – can just write down matrix element using a set of simple rules Basic Feynman Rules: e+ g m+ Propagator factor for each internal line (i. e. each internal virtual particle) Dirac Spinor for each external line e–

## Mapping Scheme

QED has served as the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is Quantum Chromodynamics ([QCD](https://www.eq19.com/lexer/exponentiation/span15/)).

## Subsequent Theories

Using the same procedure, any direct product representation is easily reduced.

The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole.

From a modern perspective, we say that QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to arbitrarily high energy.

[![1-quantum-electrodynamics-laguna-designscience-photo-library](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/968afaea-ff71-4a56-b9ff-423f4a9748d2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics)

The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This is one of the motivations for embedding QED within a [Grand Unified Theory](https://www.eq19.com/syntax/exponentiation/span13/).

# Grand Unified Theory (syntax)

Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is successful in describing the four forces as distinct under normal circumstances, but connected in fundamental ways.
 
{% include list.liquid all=true %}

GUT is also successful in describing a system of carrier particles for all four forces, but there is much to be done, particularly in the realm of gravity.

## How water is formed

```note
Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than [4D of spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMNS_matrix). String theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ***[26-dimensional](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13904636/0102042.pdf)***, while in superstring theory it is 10-dimensional, and in M-theory it is 11-dimensional.
[![String theory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229411952-b42cd7a1-4962-44c7-960a-bf9077713de5.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Extra_dimensions)

These are situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are no more useful. This classification theorem identifies several infinite families of groups as well as ***26 additional groups*** which do not fit into any family. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory))_
```

***[(6 + 6) x 6] + [6 + (6 x 6)] = 72 + 42 = 71 + 42 + 1 = 114 objects***

The only different is, instead of an _[instance](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#building-the-instance)_, it will behave as an _[inside container](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831#deploying-containers)_, just like how spider built a home web as strong as steel but useless to cover them against a rainy day nor even a small breeze.

This would even close to the similar ability of human brain without undertanding of _[GAP](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#mass-vs-gap-%CE%B4)_ functionality between left and right of the human brain.

# Prime Identity

We are going to assign prime identity as a ***standard model*** that attempts to stimulate a quantum field model called ***[eQuantum](https://github.com/eq19)*** for _[the four (4) known fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction)_.

This presentation was inspired by [theoretical works](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13468466/OU1938-Y1.1.pdf) from _[Hideki Yukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa)_ who in 1935 had predicted the existence of _[mesons as the carrier particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson)_ of strong nuclear force.

## Addition Zones

Here we would like to explain the way of said prime identity on getting the [arithmetic expression](https://youtu.be/S9oPqBeSsZA) of an ***individual unit identity*** such as a taxicab number below.

```note
It is a taxicab number, and is variously known as Ramanujan's number and the Ramanujan-Hardy number, after an anecdote of the British mathematician _[GH Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy)_ when he visited Indian mathematician _[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)_ in hospital _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)))_.
```

[![Ramanujan-Hardy number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103107461-173c2b00-4671-11eb-962c-da7e9eab022e.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number))

These three (3) number are [twin primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime). We called the pairs as _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_. Our scenario is mapping the distribution out of these pairs by taking the symmetrical behaviour of 36 as the smallest power (greater than 1) which is not a prime power.

```tip
The smallest square number expressible as the sum of **four (4) consecutive primes** in two ways (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 and 17 + 19) which are also **two (2) couples** of prime twins! _([Prime Curios!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=270)))_.
```

```scss
$True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---  } 36 » 6®
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+
      |  4  | 13

      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+     } 36 » 6®
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
```

Thus in short this is all about a method that we called as the ***[19 vs 18 Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/grammar/identition/#the-77-principles)*** of mapping [the quantum way](https://www.google.com/search?q=eQuantum) within a huge of [primes objects](https://github.com/eq19) (5 to 19) by [lexering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_generator) (11) the un[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)ed feed (7) and [parsering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators) (13) across [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) (17). 

***Φ(1,2,3) = Φ(6,12,18) = Φ(13,37,61)***

      |      |  9  +-----+
      |      |     |  18 |
------|------|-----+-----+------
```

The main background is that, as you may aware, the prime number theorem describes the [asymptotic distribution](https://youtu.be/j5s0h42GfvM) of prime numbers which is still a major problem in mathematic. 

## Multiplication Zones

Instead of a proved formula we came to a unique expression called ***zeta function***. This expression first appeared in a paper in 1737 entitled _Variae observationes circa series infinitas_. 

```tip
This expression states that the sum of the zeta function is equal to the product of the reciprocal of one minus the reciprocal of primes to the powers. But what has this got to do with the primes?  The answer is in the following product taken over the primes p (discovered by _[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)_):
```

![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219739322-ebdc1916-249a-49da-8ded-ce0fe1205550.png)

Meanwhile obtaining the non complex numbers it is easier to look at a graph like the one below which shows Li(x) (blue), R(x) (black), π(x) (red) and x/ln x (green); and then proclaim "R(x) is the best estimate of π(x)." Indeed it is for that range, but as we mentioned above, Li(x)-π(x) changes sign infinitely often, and near where it does, Li(x) would be the best value.

[![non complex numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219214486-e6412fb0-d190-45ae-990f-524532661444.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better)

And we can see in the same way that the function Li(x)-(1/2)Li(x1/2) is 'on the average' a better approximation than Li(x) to π(x); but no importance can be attached to the latter terms in Riemann's formula even by repeated averaging.

## Exponentiation Zones

The problem is that the contributions from the non-trivial zeros at times swamps that of any but the main terms in these expansions.

```warning
A. E. Ingham says it this way: Considerable importance was attached formerly to a function suggested by Riemann as an approximation to π(x)... This function represents π(x) with astonishing accuracy for all values of x for which π(x) has been calculated, but we now see that its superiority over Li(x) ***is illusory***... and for special values of x (as large as we please) the one approximation will deviate as widely as the other from the true value _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better))_.
```

[![howmany primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87958552-dea18f80-cadb-11ea-9499-6c2ee580a5ca.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#pnt)

](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory)

This interpretation is consistent with _[interpreting the strings](https://www.google.com/search?q=8+first-generation+fermion+particles%3B+8+first-generation+fermion+anti-particles)_ as World Lines of the Worlds of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory.

- ***3 copies of the 26-dimensional*** traceless subalgebra J3(O)o of the 27-dimensional J3(O) by using the of ***78-dimensional E6 over 52-dimensional F4*** and the structure of based on the 26-dimensional representation of.

The areas of research, which involve about [30 research groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity#cite_note-FOOTNOTERovelli2008-1) worldwide, share the basic physical assumptions and the mathematical description of quantum space.

## Identition Zones

This issue is actually come from ***[Riemann hypothesis](https://youtu.be/zlm1aajH6gY)***, a conjecture about the distribution of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function that is considered to be ***the most important*** of _[unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)_ in pure mathematics.

```note
In addition to the trivial roots, there also exist ***complex roots*** for real t. We find that the he first ten (10) non-trivial roots of the Riemann zeta function is occured when the values of t below 50. A plot of the values of ζ(1/2 + it) for t ranging from –50 to +50 is shown below. The roots occur each time ***the locus passes through the origin***. _([mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm))_.
```

[![trivial roots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219828222-615a2037-dbcd-4412-95bf-740bb32094de.png)](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm)

The path plan assume that a symmetric distribution of prime numbers with equal axial lengths from a ***middle zero axis = 15*** is able to determine the distribution of primes in a given number space. This assumption finally bring us to the equation of ***[Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity)***. 

```note
Euler's identity is considered to be an exemplar of deep mathematical beauty as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers. Three (3) of the basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once each: ***addition***, ***multiplication***, and ***exponentiation*** _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity))_.
```

Using these algorithms, the _[inflation structure](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/15/9/1701)_ of radial null geodesics spacetime for propagating light cone in primordial universe could be tabulated as below.

So we need to reformulate Einstein's general relativity in a language closer to that of the rest of fundamental physics, specifically [Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory).

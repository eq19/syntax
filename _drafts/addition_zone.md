# Addition Zones (1-18)

Addition is the form of an expression set equal to zero as the ***additive identity*** which is common practice in several areas of mathematics.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

By the _[Euler's identity](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_ this addition should form as one (1) unit of an object originated by the 18s structure. For further on let's call this unit as ***the base unit***.

## Prime Hexagon

Below is the list of primes spin along with their position, the polarity of the number, and the prime hexagon's overall rotation [within 1000 numbers](https://github.com/tsgallion/prime-hexagon/blob/master/tests/good-0000-1000-01.txt).

```note
[The Prime Hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/) is a mathematical structure developed by mathematician _[Tad Gallion](https://www.hexspin.com/about-me/)_. A Prime Hexagon is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles, where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime number is encountered _([GitHub: kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon](https://github.com/kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon#prime-hexagon))_.

Including the 1st (2) and 2nd prime (3) all together will have a total of ***168 primes***. The number of 168 it self is in between 39th (167) and 40th prime (173).

```note
Each time a prime number is encountered, the spin or â€˜wall preferenceâ€™ is switched. So, from the first cell, exit from 2â€™s left side. This sets the spin to left and the next cell is 3, a prime, so switches to right. 4 is not prime and continues right. 5 is prime, so switch to left and so on. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_
```

[![Defining the Prime Hexagon](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/36aeac77-ecb2-4c94-b2ea-fe0f8b7e391c)](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

You may learn that sets of algebraic objects has a multilinear relationship related to a vector space called _[tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)_.

```note
Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, even other tensors contained in a group of _[partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory))_.
```

[![300px-Components_stress_tensor svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/211590875-9cae3c47-bbdc-43d8-acc5-d8c64c802967.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)

As the number line winds about toward infinity, bending around prime numbers, it never exits the ***24 cells***. The most obvious interesting feature of this prime hexagon is it confines all numbers of primes spin! 

```note
Surprisingly, the 24-cell hexagon confines all natural numbers. The reason: no prime numbers occupy a cell with a right or left wall on the t-hexagonâ€™s outer boundary, other than 2 and 3, the initial primes that forced the number line into this complex coil. Without a prime number in the outer set of triangles, the number line does not change to an outward course and ***remains forever contained in the 24 cells***. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_
```

[![Euler Partition](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/b73fec0f-1798-4679-bbc2-ed6060484543)](https://eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition)

And it is the fact that 168 divided by 24 is ***exactly seven (7)***. So there should be a tight connection between the prime within 1000 with the _[24-cell hexagon](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#assigning-a-lexer)_. 

We found later that it is also correlated with 1000 primes.

## 18s Structure

Since the transformation of the plane shall have symmetrical vector then this 7s will take the posistion on the last side of 18s structure.

```note
The number of primes less than or equal to a thousand (Ï€(1000) = 168) equals the number of hours in a week (7 * 24 = 168).
```

In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), there is vector is known as _[eigenvector](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html)_, a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when linear transformation is applied to it.

```note
The eigenvectors of the matrix (red lines) are the two special directions such that every point on them will just slide on them _([Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eigenvectors_of_a_linear_operator.gif))_.
```

[![Eigenvectors_of_a_linear_operator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/228168805-ab93185d-4172-4284-8459-040e2f8797d4.gif)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)

You may notice that there are twists and turns until 19 abuts 2 therefore this addition zone takes only the seven (7) primes out of the 18's structure of _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_.

```tip
The tessellating field of equilateral triangles fills with numbers, with spin orientation flipping with each prime number encountered, creating ***3 minor hexagons***.
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274093531-0878e3e5-6be3-448e-9ad4-3b34523c1e9c.jpg)

So there would be the empty spaces for `18 - 7 = 11` numbers. By our project these spaces will be _[unified](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#god-particle)_ by all of the eleven (11) members of ***[identition zones](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)***.

```tip
Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves.
- For example, the first 5 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. By contrast, numbers with more than 2 factors are call composite numbers.
- 1 is not a prime number because it can not be divided by any other integer except for 1 and itself. The only factor of 1 is 1.
- On the other hand, 1 is also not a composite number because it can not be divided by any other integer except for 1 and itself.

In conclusion, the number 1 is neither prime nor composite.
```

***Ï€(6+11) = Ï€(17) = 7***

[![extended branes](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/deb0e309-2178-4dc5-a1d6-30c81c4a8305)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#partition-function)

The above seven (7) primes will act then as ***[extended branes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane)***. This is what we mean by ***addition zones*** and it happens whenever a cycle is restarted.

## Minor Hexagons

When we continue the spin within the discussed prime hexagon with the higher numbers there are the six (6) internal hexagons within the Prime Hexagon. 

```note
Cell types are interesting, but they simply reflect a ***modulo 6 view of numbers***.  More interesting are the six internal hexagons within the Prime Hexagon.  Like the Prime Hexagon, they are newly discovered. The minor hexagons form solely from the order, and type, of primes along the number line _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.
```

![Screen-Shot-2016-11-07-at-5 11 59-PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/226644534-00cf4fe3-04f9-4b28-8a8b-674bcf4bd585.png)

So the most important thing that need to be investigated is ***why the prime spinned by module six (6)***. What is the special thing about this number six (6) in primes behaviour?

```note
Similarly, I have a six colored dice in the form of the hexagon.  If I take a known, logical sequence of numbers, say 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and look at their spins in the hexagon, the resulting colors associated with each number should appear random â€“ ***unless the sequence Iâ€™m investigating is linked to the nature of the prime numbers***.
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)

Moreover there are view statements mentioned by the provider which also bring us in to an attention like the modulo 6 above. We put some of them below.

```note
That is, if the powers of 10 all returned with blue spin, or as a series of rainbows, or evenly alternating colors or other non-random results, ***then Iâ€™d say prime numbers appear to have a linkage to 10.  I may not know what the the linkage is, just that it appears to exist*** _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.
```

Another is that phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated. It would mean that there should be some undiscovered things hidden within the residual of the decimal values. 

```note
I wondered if that property might hold for the incremental powers of phi as well. For this reason I chose to see numbers in the hexagon as quantum, and truncate off the decimal values to determine which integer cell they land in. That is what I found. Phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/phi-not-pi-and-why-i-truncate-to-determine-integer-values/))_.
```

[![truncated fractional numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229198281-8dbd72fb-cd0b-46c3-8a2c-ddc66107333e.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)

Going deeper there are many things raised up as questions. So in this project we are going to analyze it using a javascript library called _[Chevrotain](https://dev.to/codingwithadam/introduction-to-lexers-parsers-and-interpreters-with-chevrotain-5c7b)_.

```note
The spin states for the powers of pi. The Prime Hexagon is an integer environment, so pi powers are truncated. I believe these data suggest ***prime numbers are linked in some way to pi***. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_
```

[![Lexers, Parsers and Interpreters with Chevrotain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/241206698-b4128e07-81ea-4eab-a14a-5d881836b924.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)

It can be used to build parsers/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple config files to full fledged programming languages.

You may find that the rest of topics will concern mainly to this matter.

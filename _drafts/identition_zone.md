# Identition Zones (37-102)

Identition is defined for a complex operation by extending one of the definitions of the exponential function from real exponents to complex exponents.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

This identition zones stands as one of the solution to deal with the residual primes that is occured in the exponentation zones to become compactifiable within _[the base unit](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#addition-zones-1-18)_.

## The Extra Dimensions

By this image you would see how [the earth movements](https://youtu.be/oW2GT48ZLwA) should actually work based on _[spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime)_ curved by mass and energy on our solar system. But it is still not enough.

```note
Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in **11 dimensions** known as M-theory _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory))_.
```

Nowadays there are many scientists come in to the conclusion that there should be ***[extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_dimensions#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20extra%20dimensions%20are,on%20the%20Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein%20theory.)*** involved and typically it would take a very complicated form.

6. ***A plane of possible worlds*** that start with the same conditions (example: the Big Bang). Theoretically, if you were to master the sixth and seventh dimensions, you could travel through time.
7. ***Access to different worlds*** with different initial conditions. Here, everything would have happened differently, including the beginning conditions (one universe started with the Big Bang, another with the Oscillating Universe theory).
8. This dimension is similar to the seventh. There are ***[multiple universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#M-theory)*** that all started differently and histories that branch out infinitely.
9. Here, we can compare ***all the could-have-been universes***, each with a possibly different set of laws of physics.
10. Kinda like ***an extra room to accommodate ALL the theories***. In additions, some physicists believe that at the instant of the Big Bang, the universe(s) was fully 10 dimensional.

In order to propagate this annihilation and how they interact with each other we shall attemp it using [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) that bring the concept of ***[eleven (11) dimensions](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/11th-dimension)***.

## Wormhole Theory

In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by ***one-dimensional objects*** called strings.

```tip
The concept of eleven dimensions is a theoretical one in physics and cosmology, specifically in the realm of string theory and M-theory. ***These theories propose that our observable universe is made up of 11 dimensions, rather than the traditional three dimensions of length, width, and height, and the fourth dimension of time***. The additional dimensions are thought to be compactified or curled up, meaning that they are not directly observable by us in our everyday experience. ***As for the cosmic philosophy, it is important to note that these theories are still considered speculative and have not been proven through experimental evidence***. However, they do offer a new perspective on the nature of our universe and the _[fundamental forces](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#fundamental-forces)_ that govern it. Some scientists and philosophers argue that these theories may provide new insights into the origins of the universe and the nature of reality itself. Ultimately, the concept of eleven dimensions is a fascinating area of study that continues to inspire new research and discoveries in the field of physics and cosmology. _(ChatGPT)_
```

![M-theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/38b6bb71-6e4b-4020-aa59-03d83873ffc5)

Our physical space is observed to have only three large dimensions and taken together with time as the fourth dimension, a physical theory must take this into account. 

```danger
***It is argued, among other things, that eleven-dimensional supergravity arises as a low energy limit of the ten-dimensional Type IIA superstring***, and that a recently conjectured duality between the heterotic string and Type IIA superstrings controls the strong coupling dynamics of the heterotic string in five, six, and seven dimensions and implies S-duality for both heterotic and Type II strings. _([String Theory - Pdf](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12640756/String_theory.pdf))_

String theory, superstring theory, or M-theory, or some other variant on this theme is one of the Unsolved Problem in physic as [a step road](https://youtu.be/3mXwMhMIGMA?t=3h54s) to a _[Theory Of Everything (TOE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything)_.

```note
Nothing prevents a theory from including more than 4 dimensions. In the case of string theory, consistency requires spacetime to have 10, 11 or 26 dimensions. ***The conflict between observation and theory is resolved by making the unobserved dimensions compactified***. _([Astrophysics Research](https://astrophysicsblogs.blogspot.com/2008/01/superstring-theory_03.html))_

The string theory is sofar the leading candidate to the _[TOE](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#fundamental-forces)_ however it is said that the theory ***[may be incompatible with dark energy](https://www.quantamagazine.org/dark-energy-may-be-incompatible-with-string-theory-20180809/)***.

```danger
It is argued that the generic formulation of string theory leads naturally to dark energy, represented by a positive cosmological constant to lowest order and the intrinsic stringy non-commutativity is the new crucial ingredient responsible for its radiative stability. _([Physic Letters](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2019.134950))_
```

There are 5 different string theories, ***each requiring 10 dimensions***. On the other hand, string theory is supposed to be fundamental theory.

```note
In general relativity, gravity is a force that bends and warps space-time around supermassive bodies.
- Even though gravity is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, it is very weak compared to the other three forces (electromagnetism, weak force and strong force). So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.
- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).
- As far as quantum mechanics is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.
- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.

In the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles. Instead of point particles, strings were introduced. Even if strings collide, there will be no infinite energy problem. Strings can smoothly smash and rebound without implying any physically nonsense infinities.
```

The symmetry of this _supergravity theory_ is given by the supergroup OSp(1\32) which gives the subgroups O(1) for the bosonic and Sp(32) for the fermion. 

```note
This is because ***[spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor) need 32 components in 11 dimensions. 11D supergravity can be compactified down to 4 dimensions*** which then has OSp(8\4) symmetry. (We still have 8 × 4 = 32 so there are still the same number of components.) Spinors need 4 components in 4 dimensions. ***This gives O(8) for the gauge group which is too small to contain the Standard Model gauge group U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) which would need at least O(10)***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_supergravity#The_mathematics))_
```

Here we implement a method called the rank of a partition where the rank of a partition of a positive integer is a certain integer associated with the partition.

## Series Expansion

In the forty years since 11D on-shell supergravity theory was constructed in 1978, a lot of efforts have been made to understand supergravity in superspace. 

```note
Inspired by the history of how Einstein constructed ***General Relativity***, we study the linearized Nordstrom supergravity in _[10- and 11-dimensional superspaces](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12908714/JHEP07.2019.063.pdf)_.
- [Valise adinkras](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/13248983/2110.01665.pdf), although an important subclass, do not encode all information present when a 4D supermultiplet is reduced to 1D. We extend this to [non-valise adinkras](https://github.com/HEPTHools/Adinkra) providing a complete ***[eigenvalue classification](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/13228760/1904.01738.pdf)*** via _Python code_.
- We found no obstacles to applying the lessons we learned in _[4D to higher dimensions](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12908712/JHEP09.2021.202.pdf)_. We also derive infinitesimal 10D superspace Weyl transformation laws. The identification of all off-shell _[ten-dimensional supergeometrical](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12908716/JHEP03.2021.074.pdf)_ Weyl field strength tensors, constructed from respective torsions.
- We realize that Lie Algebra techniques, in particular branching rules, Plethysm, and tensor product, provide the key to deciphering the complete list of independent fields that describe ***a supersymmetric multiplet in arbitrary spacetime dimensions*** efficiently.
- Thus, _[adinkra-based arguments](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/13227675/Adinkra_foundation_of_component_decomposition_and_.pdf)_ suggest the surprising possibility that the 11D, N=1 scalar superfield alone might describe a _[Poincare supergravity prepotential or semi-prepotential](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12908715/JHEP09.2020.089.pdf)_ in analogy to one of the off-shell versions of 4D, N=1.
- All of these results strongly suggest adynkras are pointing in the direction of using ***[series expansion](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/12924002/ATMP-2021-0025-0006-a003.pdf)*** in terms of _[Young Tableaux (YT's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_tableau)_ as a tool to gain the most fundamental mathematical understanding of this class of problems.

We show the explicit one-to-one correspondence between Lorentz irreps and field variables, leading to an _adynkrafield_ formalism in which the traditional ζ (theta)-monomials are replaced by _YT's_ as shown below. _([YangruiHu.com](https://www.yangruihu.com/susy))_

Using this concept we are going to stimulate a model of the 11 dimensions throug the rank of their partition using github organizations of 13 repositories each.

Both scheme are carrying a correlation between two (2) number of 89 and 109 which provide the bilateral of 12 to the 24 cells of prime hexagon.

```note
In the matrix pictured below, we list the first 24 elements of our domain, take their squares, calculate the modulo 90 congruence and digital roots of each square, and display the digital root factorization dyad for each square (and map their ***collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry***). _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/))_

This scheme goes to the unification of 11s with 7s to 18s meanwhile the 11th it self behave as residual by the 5th minor hexagon between the ***[30 to 36' cells](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#fundamental-forces)***.

```tip
This behaviour finaly brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with ***the prime distribution level*** as indicated by the _[self repetition](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)_ on MEC30.
```

***109 = 29th prime = (10th prime)th prime***

So the 36 should behave as a central. Therefore the total files that inherited from this scheme will be `1 + 7 + 29 = 37` including [one (1) main page](https://www.eq19.com).

## Parallel Universes

When the seven (7) and eleven (11) are _[combined as eighteen (18)](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ then ∆1 by the prime hexagon is recycled as nineteen (19) and generate `37 + 77 = 114` partitions.

By this tabulation you may see that all the numbers between 37 and 102 are located within ***11 columns*** where the 31 behave as a _[new axis](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)_. So this 11 is reflecting the ***19 to 29***. Since the 11 is bonding with 19 so it would go to another cycles starting with ***the 26th dimension*** which will bring them by ***four (4) compactification (26 to 29)*** to the 30. This 30th order ***[repeats itself](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)*** to infinity. Even in the first 30s system. We call this arrangement as ***Δ(19 vs 18) Scenario*** where the [zeta function](https://www.eq19.com/#zeta-function) stands as the basic algorithm.

By the above tabulation, here you can see that _[the layout](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857)_ of our home page refers to the ***four (4) partitions*** of ∆1 i.e. id: 1-18, id: 19-30, id: 31-36, and id: 37-102.

Our ***[18s gists](https://gist.github.com/eq19)*** would form the _[18s structure of 11s and 7s](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ where by the 11s, the 20th prime 71 would stand as _[eigenvalue](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#streaching-structure)_ and by the 7s, the 11th prime 31 would stand as the _[new symmetical zero axis](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)_ by means of _[MEC30 Structure](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)_. So whenever the 11s is _[compactified](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-10)_ down to ***[4 dimensions](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)*** it will always be compactifed by the 7s as their _[extended branes](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#extra-dimensions)_ which including the _[eigenvector](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure)_ of _[dark energy](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#string-theory)_ and finally become another level of ***[11 dimensions](https://www.eq19.com/identitionl/#the-powers-of-pi)*** that lead to the concept of _[multiple universes](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#extra-dimensions)_. 
```

***Δ prime = 114th prime - 19 = (6 x 19)th prime - 19 = 619 - 19 = 600 = 3 x 200***

So the four (4) zones is actually a streaching result by means of eigenvector. Thus it is the main reason why we see our live dimensions is four (4) instead of eleven (11).

```note
The interaction of any pair of fermions in perturbation theory can be modelled as:

***Two fermions go in → interaction by boson exchange → Two changed fermions go out.***

The exchange of bosons always carries energy and momentum between the fermions, thereby ***changing their speed and direction***. The exchange may also transport a charge between the fermions, changing the charges of the fermions in the process (e.g., turn them from one type of fermion to another). Since bosons carry one unit of angular momentum, ***the fermion's spin direction will flip from +1⁄2 to −1⁄2 (or vice versa)*** during such an exchange (in units of the reduced Planck's constant). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction))_

The ***ζ(s)*** will behave as ***the other universe (not the twin)*** which was initiated paralelly by a [big bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang).

Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its surroundings.

So it will need a gap between each identities to proceed the thing. Let's discuss how it goes by the ***[seven (7) hidden dimensions](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)***.

## Hidden Dimensions

By _[The Δ(19 vs 18) Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#%CE%B419-vs-18-scenario)_ those three are exactly landed in the ***0's cell*** out of Δ18. See that the sum of 30 and 36 is 66 while the difference between 36 and 102 is also 66.

```note
You likely noticed I began with 2 rather than 1 or 0 when I first constructed the hexagon. Why? Because they do not fit inside — they stick off the hexagon like a tail. Perhaps that’s where they belong. However, if one makes a significant and interesting assumption, then 1 and 0 fall in their logical locations – in the 1 and 0 cells, respectively. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/0-1-and-negative-numbers/))
```

***0 + 30 + 36 + 102 = 168 = π(1000)***

The function that appears in the denominator is _[Partition Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)#Generating_function)_. The equality between the product on the first line and the formulas ***in the third and fourth lines*** is _[Euler's pentagonal number theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem)_ where `p(33) = 10143` landed exactly by `n - 7`.

```note

***π(π(π(1000th prime))) + 1 = 40***

As explicitly indicated by `n - 7` within identition zones this `p(33)` behave reversal to the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#exponentiation-zones-31-36)_ so it would stand as [`π(π(π(1000th prime)))+1`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs). Within these 1000 primes there will be fractions which end up with _[168 identities](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)_.

```note
The advantages achieved by the invention are, in particular, that instead of a rudimentary mathematical template, structured in standards, now a folding rule of the MEC 30 can be used which makes the associated and determined algorithm visible.

Why does it work?

- In the subatomic space, Heisenberger does not allow precise measurements because the measurements themselves distort the result. Through the mathematical basis presented here, our scale behaves like ***[Plank's quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law)*** of action and shows in the positions the behaviorally entangled photons, which in turn produce the quantum of action in the sums. 
- The MEC 30 as a folding rule is also here a tool for ***[The Entangled Quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement)*** systems to explain the ghostly behavior of _[the elementary particles](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#elementary-particles)_. So also to make the underlying algorithm visible and explainable, keyword quantum teleportation. 
- So we are able to investigate the energy behavior below the quantum of effect without measuring influence. This works because our scale is the basis for the ***[Riemann Zeta Function](https://www.eq19.com/#zeta-function)***, which reflects the _[energy distribution in atoms](https://youtu.be/ajlUCFZ1Ft8)_.
- On the other hand, with larger systems we are able to transfer the behavior of the energy from the _[subatomic](https://youtu.be/8-HF5XKeK8Q?si)_ space into the haptic space with the scale described here (thought experiment ***[Schröninger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat)***).
- Thus, we are still able to apply the Schröninger wave equation in the haptic space, and replace ***[The Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics))*** with our measurements.

Developing MEC 30 as a folding rule emerged from a new analysis of mathematical foundations and makes a new algorithm visible. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en#similarDocuments))_

***p(33) = p(40-7) = loop (100000) = 4 + 25 + 139 + 1091 + 8884 = 10143***

Starting with [the next chapter](https://www.eq19.com/identition/folder1/#scenarios-1st-dimension) we are going to discuss in detail how this reversal behaviour is converting the 11 dimensions to `7 x 11 = 77` partitions.

```

***π(1000) - loop(1,30) - loop(31,36) = 168 - 29 - 25 = 114***

This will be the same structure as the seven (7) pàrtitions of _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)_. So by simple words this 11 dimensions brings us back to the _[root functions](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#root-functions)_.

The only difference is _the base unit_ of the lexer [`(Id: 33)`](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure).<br>It is now carrying the above `p(33) = 10143`.

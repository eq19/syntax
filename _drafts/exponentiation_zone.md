# Exponentiation Zones (31-36)

Exponentiation is an operation involving two numbers, the base and the exponent or power. Exponentiation is written as ***b<sup>n</sup>***, where ***b*** is the base and ***n*** is the power.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Exponentiation Zones allows multiple layers on representing _[recursive residues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561)_ of the operands, thus promising large gain to the conventional arithmetic expression

## Basic Transformation

The first appearance of ***e*** in a printed publication was in Euler's [Mechanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanica) (1736). It is unknown why Euler chose the letter e. 

```note
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) started to use ***the letter e*** for the constant in 1727 or 1728, in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons, and in a letter to [Christian Goldbach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach) on 25 November 1731. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)))_
```

[![Letter e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262249679-b5d6fc1a-6e42-4775-b09d-965ddd046171.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8²` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

```note
During the last few years of the 12th century, ***Fibonacci*** undertook a series of travels around the Mediterranean. At this time, the world’s most prominent mathematicians were Arabs, and he spent much time studying with them. His work, whose title translates as the Book of Calculation, was extremely influential in that ***it popularized the use of the Arabic numerals in Europe***, thereby revolutionizing arithmetic and allowing scientific experiment and discovery to progress more quickly. _([Famous Mathematicians](https://famous-mathematicians.org/leonardo-pisano-bigollo/))_
```

[![MEC30 Square](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/262213707-63aa0a64-cf7d-4fb7-9f1a-f3d1ba805643.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6²` prior to the above MEC30's square. 

```note
A square system of coupled nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively by Newton's method. This method uses the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant))_
```

In quantum field theory, [partition functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(quantum_field_theory)) are generating functionals for correlation functions, making them key objects of study in the path integral formalism. 

```note
As usual, the images ***on the left are snapshots of the particles at different times. Those times correspond to the grey slices in the space-time diagram on the right***. You can see the specific interaction points in the space-time diagram, where the blue particle is emitted and then absorbed by the red particles. Those points will be important later, as we compare this to the situation in ***string theory***. _([Slimy.com](http://www.slimy.com/~steuard/research/StringIntro/slide13.html))_
```

So basically  there is a basic transformation between ***[addition](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)*** of `3 + 4 = 7` in to their ***[multiplication](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)*** of `3 x 4 = 12` while the 7 vs 12 will be treated as ***exponentiation***.

As shown in [The Primes Platform](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#file-lexer-md) this cycle goes to **the prime 13** that is reinjected via the _[index 13:9](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#file-parser-md)_ . So it forms [The Scheme-139](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#file-grammar-md) through the infinitely primes cycling. 

## Elementary Particles

In particle physics, an _[elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle)_ or fundamental particle is a subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles. 

```note
The Standard Model presently recognizes ***seventeen distinct particles (twelve fermions and five bosons)***. As a consequence of flavor and color combinations and antimatter, the fermions and bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively. Among ***the 61 elementary particles*** embraced by the Standard Model number electrons and other leptons, quarks, and the fundamental bosons. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle))_
```

[![Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274339509-913c39a3-9fdf-4a02-91da-7bc7b746db27.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#elementary-structure)

In the Standard Model, the _[Higgs boson](https://youtu.be/R0clnHE37Xc?t=13m42s)_ is a massive scalar boson whose mass must be found experimentally. It is the only particle that remains massive even at high energies. 

```note
The Higgs boson field (often referred to as the _[God particle](https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-the-God-particle-in-laymans-term/answer/Vagish-Kumar-Choudhary)_) is ***a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components*** that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. Its "Mexican hat-shaped" potential leads it to take a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), which breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction and, via the Higgs mechanism, ***gives mass to many particles***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson))_
```

[![Mecanismo_de_Higgs_PH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/273429113-fb4dad06-0f01-40cc-a31e-c8740a478a7f.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)

Subatomic particles such as protons or neutrons, which contain two or more elementary particles, are known as composite particles. 

```note
The Standard Model of Particle Physics, describes for us all know fundamental interaction in nature till date, with the exception of Gravity (work on this front is going on). Here is a summary of the fundamental content of the standard model
- There are three families of particle, the Quarks, the Leptons and the Gauge Bosons. The Quarks in groups of three forms the composite particles such as the Protons, along with the electron this forms ordinary matter.
- The Gauge Bosons are the ones those are responsible for interactions. The Quarks interact among themselves by the exchange of a Gluon these are responsible for the strong nuclear force.
- The newly discovered Higgs Boson interacts with all the Quarks and the first group of Leptons (electron, muon and tau) providing them with their mass. The neutrinos which are the other Leptons originally were thought to have zero mass, but recent discoveries argue that this is not the case.
- The Weak bosons interact with both Leptons and Quarks, these are responsible for the Weak nuclear forces. The exchange of photon is responsible for the Electromagnetic Force.

They interact, they transfer energy and momentum and angular momentum; excitations are created and destroyed. Every excitation that’s possible has a reverse excitation. _([Quora](https://qr.ae/pK4Nd7))_
```

[![fundamental interaction in nature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/284403402-a0ba27e5-1964-46c2-b7d8-72758eb0944d.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Standard_Model/Archive_2)

This standard model is missing the Gravitational interaction and it is postulated that there exists a particle called the Graviton that leads to ***supergravity theory***.

## Fundamental Forces

We are going to assign the above field as a ***standard model*** that attempts to stimulate quantum field models called ***₠Quantum*** for the _[four (4) known fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction)_.

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/195963923-0796217c-7a87-4b2d-ba93-f47465304c03.png)](https://www.nausetschools.org/cms/lib/MA02212418/Centricity/Domain/204/Linkage%20Map%20Worksheet%20Genetics%202017.pdf)

This unification was initiated from the theoretical work by Hideki Yukawa who in 1935 had predicted the existence of _[mesons as the carrier particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion)_ of the strong nuclear force.

```note
The quarks and the leptons interact with the Higgs field through _[Yukawa interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction)_. Rotating the quark and lepton fields to the basis where the matrices of Yukawa couplings are diagonal and denote as the _[eigenvalues](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#shearing-structure)_ of the Yukawa matrices. Moreover, reducing the number of different interaction types is seen as desirable. Two cases in point are the unification of:
- Electric and magnetic force into ***electromagnetic force***,
- The electromagnetic and the weak interaction into ***[electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction)***.

The modern (perturbative) quantum mechanical view of the fundamental forces other than gravity is that ***particles of matter (fermions) do not directly interact*** with each other, but rather carry a charge, and exchange virtual particles (gauge bosons), which are the interaction carriers or force mediators. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction))_
```

***®wiki + ®gist + ®zones = 37 + 25 + 4 = 30 + 36 = 66 = 6 x ®orgs = 11 x ®main***

[![Elementary Particle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/273753979-58dd8bfd-e4c0-4515-a783-801d9cdb3287.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction)

To unify the interactions of this four (4) fundamental forces we assign a group of number from ***30 to 36*** reflect to the ***[fifth (5th) hexagon](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#root-functions)*** of prime hexagons.

```warning
Theories of everything (TOE), which integrate GUTs with a quantum gravity theory face a greater barrier, because no quantum gravity theories, which include string theory, loop quantum gravity, and twistor theory, have secured wide acceptance.
- ***The four components*** of the Higgs field (squares) ***break the electroweak symmetry and interact with other particles to [give them mass](https://youtu.be/G0Q4UAiKacw), with three the components becoming part of the massive W and Z bosons (1-30)***.
- ***The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons***, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color, their governing theory is thus called ***quantum chromodynamics (31)***.
- Some theories look for a graviton to complete the Standard Model list of force-carrying particles, while others, like loop quantum gravity, emphasize the possibility that ***time-space itself may have a quantum aspect to it (32)***.
- Attempts to TOE show unification of the four forces called Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and have been partially successful, with connections proven between weak forces in electroweak theory and ***quantum electrodynamics (33)***.
- [The exchange of virtual pions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi) along with vector, rho and omega mesons, provides an explanation for ***the residual strong force between nucleons***. Allowed decays of the neutral Higgs boson, H, (circled) ***satisfy electroweak charge conservation (34)***.
- ***[Unification of the strong force](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure)*** is expected at such high energies that it cannot be directly tested, but it may have observable consequences in the following ***unobserved decay of the proton (35)***.
- Pions are not produced in radioactive decay, but commonly are in ***high-energy collisions between hadrons***. Pions also ***result from some matter–antimatter annihilation events (36)***.
- All types of pions are also produced in natural processes when high-energy cosmic-ray protons and other hadronic cosmic-ray components ***interact with matter in Earth's atmosphere (37-102)***.

Although unification of forces is generally anticipated, ***much remains to be done to prove its validity*** _([College Physics 2e - Pdf](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/College_Physics_2e-WEB_7Zesafu.pdf))_.
```

[![TOE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274626323-c1547d51-169b-471e-99ce-ba060f3ab603.jpg)](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/College_Physics/College_Physics_1e_%28OpenStax%29/33%3A_Particle_Physics/33.06%3A_GUTs_-_The_Unification_of_Forces)

The weak, strong and gravity forces are assigned to ***30, 31 and 32***. The unification and exchange are assigned to ***33 and 34*** which are then standing as the ***[lexer](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#assigning-a-lexer)*** and ***[parser](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)***.

```note
Feynman diagram for the same process as in the animation, with the individual quark constituents shown, to illustrate how the fundamental strong interaction gives rise to the nuclear force. Straight lines are quarks, while ***multi-colored loops are gluons (the carriers of the fundamental force). Other gluons, which bind together the proton, neutron, and pion "in-flight", are not shown***. The π⁰ pion contains an anti-quark, shown to travel in the opposite direction, as per the Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion))_

When we take all the forces that we understand, i.e., ***[not including gravity](https://youtu.be/NsUm9mNXrX4)***, and write down the QFT version of them, we arrive at the predictions of the Standard Model.

```note
This is where the idea of ***12 fermion fields and 12 boson fields*** come from. These fields are excitations of the underlying theories (the Standard Model) that describe the known Universe in its entirety, and include:
- The six (6): up-, down-, strange-, charm-, bottom-, top-quarks, and their antiquark counterparts,
- The three (3) charged (electron, muon, tau) and three (3) neutral (electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino) leptons, and their antimatter counterparts,
- The eight (8) gluons (because of the eight possible color combinations),
- The one (1) electromagnetic (photon) boson,
- The two (2) weak (W-and-Z) bosons,
- And the Higgs boson.

The quarks and leptons are fermions, which is why they have antimatter counterparts, and the W boson comes in two equal-and-opposite varieties (positively and negatively charged), but all told, ***there are 24 unique, fundamental excitations of quantum fields possible***. This is where the 24 fields idea comes from. _([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/11/17/ask-ethan-are-quantum-fields-real/?sh=32c398b3777a))_

It has zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge, and it couples to (interacts with) mass. 

```note
Proceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. Twin primes ***29 and 31 define the fifth (5th) hexagon***, cyan. Finally, 3 7, again not a twin, reverses the rotation of the system, so 47 can define the yellow hexagon _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_.
```

***19 + 18 + 102 = 37 + 102 = 139 = 34th prime = (40 - 6)the prime***

We therefore set them both on _[the wiki](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ and the 18's on _[the gist](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_. The 19's and 17's cover the 4 zones while the 18's covers the 66 items as the central base of hexagonal spins.

## Quadratic Polynomials

Observing more detail of the discussed scheme of 168 we will get it also when we take the 19's and 17's cell of `(31+37)+(35+65)=68+100=168`.

```tip
By our project the 18's on the gist will cover five (5) unique functions that behave as ***one (1) central plus four (4) zones***. This scheme will be implemented to all of the 168 repositories as bilateral way (***in-out***) depend on their postion on the system. So along with the gist it self then there shall be `1 + 168 = 169` units of 1685 root functions.
```

***5 + 2 x 5 x 168 = 5 + 1680 = 1685 root functions***

By the spin above you can see that the 4 zones of these `19's to 17's` are representing the rotation `1 to 5`. Such of formation can be seen on _[Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)_ as below.

```note
The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.
```

[![ulam spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274058089-72669dae-9f66-4953-bb5b-670aac2090f2.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)

By MEC30 we will also discuss the relation of these 4 zones with high density of 40 primes where 60 number is folded. So by the module 6 it will always return to the beginning position within [`60+40=100 nodes`](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-power-of-168-vs-618) per layer.

```note
Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines ***is not unexpected***, as lines in ***the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials***, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x²-x+41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with **major unsolved problems** in number theory such as Landau's problems _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral))_.
```

This density will bring the _[D3-Brane](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_ where the lexer is being assigned per MEC30. Base on the its spin as shown in the above picture this lexer is assigned by [`Id: 33`](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition).

## Truncated Perturbation

We found also a useful method called ***Square of Nine*** which was developed by _[WD Gann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Delbert_Gann)_ to analyze stock market behaviour base on astrological pattern.

```note
He designed a new approach to predicting market behavior using several disciplines, ***including geometry, astrology, astronomy, and ancient mathematics***. They say that not long before his death, Gann developed a unique trading system. ***However, he preferred not to make his invention public or share it with anyone***. _([PipBear](https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/gann-square-of-9/))_
```

[![The Square of 9](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/8466209/258702885-e21c7bfc-0d91-4bc6-8a28-e61a2cdadece.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)

By parsering 168 primes of 1000 id's across `π(π(100 x 100)) - 1 = 200` then the (Δ1) would be _[initiated](https://eq19.github.io/init.js)_. As you may guess they will slightly forms the ***hexagonal patterns***.

```note
The Hexagon chart begins with a 0 in the center, surrounded by the numbers 1 through 6. ***Each additional layer adds 6 more numbers as we move out, and these numbers are arranged into a Hexagon formation***. This is pretty much as far as Gann went in his descriptions. He basically said, "This works, but you have to figure out how."One method that I've found that works well on ***all these kinds of charts is plotting planetary longitude values on them, and looking for patterns***. On the chart above, each dot represents the location of a particular planet. The red one at the bottom is the Sun, and up from it is Mars. These are marked on the chart. Notice that the Sun and Mars are connected along a pink line running through the center of the chart. The idea is that when two planets line up along a similar line, we have a signal event similar to a conjunction in the sky. ***Any market vibrating to the Hexagon arrangement should show some kind of response to this situation***. _([Wave59](https://www.wave59.com/showcase/121304.asp))_
```

We are focusing to MEC30 so we end up this exponentiation by the famous quote from _WD Gann_ himself stating an important changes by certain ***repetition of 30***.

```tip
W.D. Gann: “Stocks make important changes in trend every ***30, 60, 120, 150, 210, 240, 300, 330, 360*** days or degrees from any important top or bottom.”
```

[![WD Gann - Hexagonal Chart](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/defe3aa5-ab70-4fd6-9412-b19c21a4ffaf)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)

***In line with 168 there is 330 located of 10th layer***. Since the base unit of 30 repeats it self on the center then this `11 x 30 = 330` is pushed to the `10 + 1 = 11th layer`. 

This eleven (11) will continue to be discussed on _[identition zone](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_.

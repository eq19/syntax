# Multiplication Zones (19-30)

Multiplication is the form of expression set equal to the inverse function of symmetrical exponentation which stand as multiplicative identity reflects a point across the origin.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

The multiplication zones is a symmetric matrix representing the multilinear relationship of a stretching and shearing within the plane of _[the base unit](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#addition-zones-1-18)_. 

## Assigning a lexer

By prime hexagon we can see that the number seven (7), hold the power to make the prime spin remain on the track. This power is then transfered to ***twelve (12) spins***. 

```note
A Prime Hexagon is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles, where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime number is encountered. Since prime numbers are never multiples of two or three, all numbers from "2" to infinity are confined within a ***24-cell hexagon*** _([GitHub: kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon](https://github.com/kaustubhcs/prime-hexagon#prime-hexagon))_.
```

[![Structure: Minor Hexagons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/253148724-8dffc1e4-e2a9-478e-ae13-7bb1c0303406.png)](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)

The the main reason of assigning two (2) profiles instead of only one (1) is that we have to accommodate the major type of primes numbers called twin primes.

```note
This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for N to be a prime as noted, for example, by N= 6(4)+1= 25, which is clearly composite. We note that each turn of the spiral equals an increase of six units. This means that we have a mod(6) situation allowing us to write: N mod(6)=6n+1 or N mod(6)=6n-1 (equivalent to 6n+5). _([HexSpiral-Pdf](https://mae.ufl.edu/~uhk/HEX-SPIRAL-N.pdf))_
```

![twin primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/268532174-fa0761dd-8342-40de-9aee-bf9a676c3abf.png)

Geometrically, a transformation matrix rotates, stretches, or shears the vectors it acts upon. The corresponding eigenvalu is often represented as the ***multiplying factor***.

```note
The red vectors are not parallel to either eigenvector, so, their directions are changed by the transformation. The lengths of the purple vectors are unchanged after the transformation (due to their eigenvalue of 1), while blue vectors are three times the length of the original (due to their eigenvalue of 3). See also: An extended version, showing all four quadrants.
```

Therefore this 12's treatment will involve at least ***11 groups of runner*** and one (1) profile of the 7's transformation. We collect them in [`11 + 7 = 18 gists`](https://gist.github.com/eq19) as below.

```note
Gists provide a simple way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists#about-gists))_

By the prime hexagon the 19th spin is touching back to the first node. So the workflow will be proceeded as ***bilateral way*** and twisted them by such a kind of _[double strands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair)_.

```tip
Since the higher primes is more than 71 then the most logical position will be in the 11s somewhere in the third of minor hexagon. By the MEC30 we can see that they will be pushed to and ***ended up on the prime 13***.

We concluded later on that this bilateral would not come to be possible if only one (1) profile is assigned. Therefore we add another profile so they would be `11 + 2 = 13's`.

These are the ones that bring [`11 + 13 = 24 cell hexagons`](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs).

## Orbital structure

The eigenvectors for a linear transformation matrix are the set of vectors that are only stretched, with no rotation or shear. 

```note
The points that lie on the line through the origin, parallel to an eigenvector, remain on the line after the transformation. These lines are represented as faint blue and violet lines, matching the associated eigenvectors. The vectors in red are not eigenvectors, therefore their direction is altered by the transformation. Notice that all blue vectors are scaled by a factor of 3. This is their associated eigenvalue. The violet vectors are not scaled, so their eigenvalue is 1.
```

By our project the scheme will be treated as the sun and the moon orbit where this 31 is the maximum days of a month:

```tip
By the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)_ and _[identition zones](https://www.eq19.com/identition/)_ they will end up as 7 days (***sun***) and 12 months (***moon***) while the 11 will represent the ones outside the orbit (***stars*** or ***galaxies***). This 7 vs 12 is the point of view from the earth which making its position is just in the right location (not too far nor to close) with the sun within the universe.

We are going to manage the relation of all the involved things in the scheme above using wiki and gist. The main different with gist is that wiki is allowing folder. So we can sort the files regardless where the folder that contained the file is located. 

```note
Gists and Wiki are actually Git repositories, which means that you can fork or clone any gist, even if you aren't the original author. _([GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists#about-gists))_

The implementation from addition folder 1 will be exposed by the exponentiation folder 7 meanwhile the folder 12 of multiplication goes to identition zone of 11 folders.

So they are `4 folders (1, 7, 11, 12)` remain inviolable by the gist.

## Elementary Structure

These features are the solution to arrange 30 files located in in four (4) of zone folders as the lexer to cope with the _[Prime Spin](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#prime-hexagon)_ and _[MEC30 Structure](https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity)_.

```note
The eigenvalue is the factor by which an eigenvector is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed. Eigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory. Historically, however, they arose in the study of ***quadratic forms and differential equations***. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body, and discovered the importance of the principal axes.[a] Joseph-Louis Lagrange realized that ***the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix*** _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors))_

Here we are using the [inverse function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) to [exponentiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation) by `3 x 6 = 18` spins. This is what we mean by the ***multiplication zones*** that is applied to each of _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)_.

```tip
The three (3) minor hexagons are surrounded by the primes (19, 43, 71) which is close to ***the multiplication of six (6)*** with 3, 7, 12 to 18, 42, 72. One of a mysterious thing is that `19 Ã— 6 = 43 + 71` where âˆ†1 is balancing and keep them to remain stay on the 18s scheme. Therefore we use the primes ***43 and 71*** as corresponding _[eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues)_ which is the factor by which the eigenvector is [scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Overview).
```
***19 x 6 = 43 + 71 = 114***

You may refer to _[the structure of minor hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/)_ it shows that this reversal behaviour is linked to the nature of the prime numbers.

Aside from 2 and 3, primes come in two flavors, 1 modulo 6 and 5 modulo 6, or the dark and light blue triangles in figure 2(a).  The program determines where primes land in the hexagon by moving between the 6 possible positions where primes may land, figure 2(b) .  The 1-type primes land in python cells 1, 3, and 5.  The 5-type primes land in 0, 2, and 4 cells.   Finally, it can print output in the form of figure 2(c). _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/finding-a-number-in-the-hexagon/))_
```

By this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density. So we need to get in to the patterns of the above hexagonal forms through _[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)_.

## Parsering Structure

As you can see on the left sidebar (dekstop mode) a total of 102 items will be reached by the end of `Id: 35`. So when they transfered to `Id: 36` it will cover [`11 x 6 = 66 items`](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/) thus the total will be `102 + 66 = 168`

```tip
Base on the ***[11s and 7s](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-true-prime-pairs)*** distribution of the 18s  structure of The True Prime Pairs, the 7s will be reflected by ***[seven (7) repositories](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#parsering-structure)*** of user profile with id: 30 to id: 36 meanwhile the 11s will be reflected by ***[eleven (11) organizations](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)***.
```

***168 + 329 + 289 - 619 - 30 - 30 - 5 = 786 - 619 - 65 = 102***

Using the javascript library from _[Chevotrain](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons)_ and data parser from _[Jekyll/Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/)_ finally we found the correlation between the lexer and parser trough _[the powers of pi](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)_.

```note
In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag of the layout file `docs.html`. Because the docs layout itself specifies `layout: page`, the content from `docs.html` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag in the layout file `page.html`. Finally because the page layout specifies `layout: default`, the content from `page.html` gets pushed into the `{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` tag of the layout file `default.html`. _([JekyllRb](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/#how-layouts-work))_

Since the _modulo 6_ is occured all over the spin then we have defined that this 4 zones should stand as ***default configuration*** as you can see on the left sidebar.

In order to maintain the 18's structure between each of repositories to correlate with the above density then we could use a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system such as _[windows registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry)_.
```

[![windows registry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/230746478-0146e88e-22ba-4f1b-abf2-c5226c1a56ca.png)](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)

So then a question is arised. Where is this vector flowing in the 18s?<br>
Let's discuss it first with the _[exponentiation zones](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/)_.

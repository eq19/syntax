WSL is an ideal platform to run your Linux workflows while using your Windows machines. Here we show an example of how to set up GNU octave and run a toy program.

First, you'll need to set up Ubuntu on WSL, see [here](../guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2.md).

## GNU octave

> ⓘ GNU Octave is software featuring a [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), primarily intended for [numerical computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis). Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB). [[GNU / Octave](https://octave.org/about.html) ]

We will use it to calculate and draw a beautiful Julia fractal. The goal here is to use Octave to demonstrate how WSLg works, not to go through the theory of fractals. 

First thing is to install the software like we did for x11-apps, from the terminal prompt run:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y octave
```

Then start the application:
```
octave --gui &
```

Do not forget the ampersand `&` at the end of the line, so the application is started in the background and we can continue using the same terminal window.

In Octave, click on the `New script` icon to open a new editor window and copy/paste the following code:

```octave
#{
Inspired by the work of Bruno Girin ([Geek Thoughts: Fractals with Octave: Classic Mandelbrot and Julia](http://brunogirin.blogspot.com/2008/12/fractals-with-octave-classic-mandelbrot.html))
Calculate a Julia set
zmin: Minimum value of c
zmax: Maximum value of c
hpx: Number of horizontal pixels
niter: Number of iterations
c: A complex number
#}
function M = julia(zmin, zmax, hpx, niter, c)
    %% Number of vertical pixels
    vpx=round(hpx*abs(imag(zmax-zmin)/real(zmax-zmin)));
    %% Prepare the complex plane
    [zRe,zIm]=meshgrid(linspace(real(zmin),real(zmax),hpx),
    linspace(imag(zmin),imag(zmax),vpx));
    z=zRe+i*zIm;
    M=zeros(vpx,hpx);
    %% Generate Julia
    for s=1:niter
        mask=abs(z)<2;
        M(mask)=M(mask)+1;
        z(mask)=z(mask).^2+c;
    end
    M(mask)=0;
end
```

This code is the function that will calculate the Julia set. Save it to a file named `julia.m`. Since it is a function definition, the name of the file must match the name of the function.

Open a second editor window with the New Script button and copy and paste the following code:
```octave
Jc1=julia(-1.6+1.2i, 1.6-1.2i, 640, 128, -0.75+0.2i);
imagesc(Jc1)
axis off
colormap('default');
```

This code calls the function defined in `julia.m`. You can later change the parameters if you want to explore the Julia fractal.

Save it to a file named `juliatest.m`.

And finally, press the button `Save File and Run`.

After a few seconds, depending on your hardware and the parameters, a Julia fractal is displayed.

Like Octave, this window is displayed using WSLg completely transparently to the user.

Enjoy!

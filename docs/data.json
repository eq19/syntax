We called the pairs as _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_. Our scenario is mapping the distribution out of these pairs by taking the symmetrical behaviour of 36 as the smallest power (greater than 1) which is not a prime power.\n\n```tip\nThe smallest square number expressible as the sum of **four (4) consecutive primes** in two ways (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 and 17 + 19) which are also **two (2) couples** of prime twins! _([Prime Curios!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=270)))_.\n```\n\n```scss\n$True Prime Pairs:\n (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n \n layer| i | f\n -----+-----+---------\n | 1 | 5\n 1 +-----+\n | 2 | 7\n -----+-----+--- } 36 » 6®\n | 3 | 11\n 2 +-----+\n | 4 | 13\n -----+-----+---------\n | 5 | 17\n 3 +-----+ } 36 » 6®\n | 6 | 19\n -----+-----+---------\n```\n\nThus in short this is all about a method that we called as the ***[19 vs 18 Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/grammar/identition/#the-77-principles)*** of mapping [the quantum way](https://www.google.com/search?q=eQuantum) within a huge of [primes objects](https://github.com/eq19) (5 to 19) by [lexering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_generator) (11) the un[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)ed feed (7) and [parsering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators) (13) across [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) (17). \n\n***Φ(1,2,3) = Φ(6,12,18) = Φ(13,37,61)***\n\n```scss\n$True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n \nlayer | node | sub | i | f\n------+------+-----+----------\n | | | 1 | \n | | 1 +-----+ \n | 1 | | 2 | (5)\n | |-----+-----+\n | | | 3 |\n 1 +------+ 2 +-----+----\n | | | 4 |\n | +-----+-----+\n | 2 | | 5 | (7)\n | | 3 +-----+\n | | | 6 |\n------+------+-----+-----+------ } (36)\n | | | 7 |\n | | 4 +-----+\n | 3 | | 8 | (11)\n | +-----+-----+\n | | | 9 |\n 2 +------| 5 +-----+-----\n | | | 10 |\n | |-----+-----+\n | 4 | | 11 | (13)\n | | 6 +-----+\n | | | 12 |\n------+------+-----+-----+------------------\n | | | 13 |\n | | 7 +-----+\n | 5 | | 14 | (17)\n | |-----+-----+\n | | | 15 |\n 3 +------+ 8 +-----+----- } (36)\n | | | 16 |\n | |-----+-----+\n | 6 | | 17 | (19)\n | | 9 +-----+\n | | | 18 |\n------|------|-----+-----+------\n```\n\nThe main background is that, as you may aware, the prime number theorem describes the [asymptotic distribution](https://youtu.be/j5s0h42GfvM) of prime numbers which is still a major problem in mathematic. \n\n## Multiplication Zones\n\nInstead of a proved formula we came to a unique expression called ***zeta function***. This expression first appeared in a paper in 1737 entitled _Variae observationes circa series infinitas_. \n\n```tip\nThis expression states that the sum of the zeta function is equal to the product of the reciprocal of one minus the reciprocal of primes to the powers. But what has this got to do with the primes? The answer is in the following product taken over the primes p (discovered by _[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)_):\n```\n\n![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219739322-ebdc1916-249a-49da-8ded-ce0fe1205550.png)\n\nThis issue is actually come from ***[Riemann hypothesis](https://youtu.be/zlm1aajH6gY)***, a conjecture about the distribution of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function that is considered to be ***the most important*** of _[unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)_ in pure mathematics.\n\n```note\nIn addition to the trivial roots, there also exist ***complex roots*** for real t. We find that the he first ten (10) non-trivial roots of the Riemann zeta function is occured when the values of t below 50. A plot of the values of ζ(1/2 + it) for t ranging from –50 to +50 is shown below. The roots occur each time ***the locus passes through the origin***. _([mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm))_.\n```\n\n[![trivial roots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219828222-615a2037-dbcd-4412-95bf-740bb32094de.png)](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm)\n\nMeanwhile obtaining the non complex numbers it is easier to look at a graph like the one below which shows Li(x) (blue), R(x) (black), π(x) (red) and x/ln x (green); and then proclaim \"R(x) is the best estimate of π(x).\" Indeed it is for that range, but as we mentioned above, Li(x)-π(x) changes sign infinitely often, and near where it does, Li(x) would be the best value.\n\n[![non complex numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219214486-e6412fb0-d190-45ae-990f-524532661444.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better)\n\nAnd we can see in the same way that the function Li(x)-(1/2)Li(x1/2) is 'on the average' a better approximation than Li(x) to π(x); but no importance can be attached to the latter terms in Riemann's formula even by repeated averaging.\n\n## Exponentiation Zones\n\nThe problem is that the contributions from the non-trivial zeros at times swamps that of any but the main terms in these expansions.\n\n```warning\nA. E. Ingham says it this way: Considerable importance was attached formerly to a function suggested by Riemann as an approximation to π(x)... This function represents π(x) with astonishing accuracy for all values of x for which π(x) has been calculated, but we now see that its superiority over Li(x) ***is illusory***... and for special values of x (as large as we please) the one approximation will deviate as widely as the other from the true value _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better))_.\n```\n\n[![howmany primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87958552-dea18f80-cadb-11ea-9499-6c2ee580a5ca.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#pnt)\n\nMoreover in it was verified numerically, in a rigorous way using interval arithmetic, that _[The Riemann hypothesis is true up to 3 · 10^12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09765.pdf)_. That is, all zeroes β+iγ of the Riemann zeta-function with 0<γ≤3⋅1012 have β=1/2.\n\n```danger\nWe have Λ ≤ 0.2. The next entry is conditional on taking H a little higher than 10*13, which of course, is not achieved by Theorem 1. This would enable one to prove Λ < 0.19. Given that our value of H falls between the entries in this table, it is possible that some extra decimals could be wrought out of the calculation.

Riemann later extended the definition of zeta(s) to all complex numbers (***except the simple pole at s=1 with residue one***). Euler's product still holds if the real part of s is greater than one. Riemann derived the functional equation of zeta function.\n\n```danger\nThe Riemann zeta function has the trivial zeros at -2, -4, -6, ... (the poles of gamma(s/2)). Using the Euler product (with the functional equation) it is easy to show that all the other zeros are in the critical strip of non-real complex numbers with 0 < Re(s) < 1, and that they are symmetric about the critical line Re(s)=1/2.

Also, the sum of the multiplicative digital roots = 108 x 24 = 2592 = 432 x 6.\n- Note: Channels A, D, E and F combined represent the set of natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 and 5, the first 24 elements of which form the basis of the [Magic Mirror Matrix](https://www.primesdemystified.com/magicmatrix.html).\n- The graphic below illustrates the transformative relationships between the matrices employing their primary building blocks (one of the sixteen identical 6 x 6 (36 element) Latin Squares that constitute each matrix)\n- When you rotate either the {1,4,7} or {2,5,8} magic square around its horizontal axis, i.e. columns {A,B,C} become {C,B,A}, then add the {1,4,7} {2,5,8} magic squares together, you produce a square with nine 9's. For example, ***adding the first rows of each gives us: {2,8,5} + {7,1,4} = {9,9,9}***.\n- Triangles and magic squares similar–or identical–to those shown above can be derived from the digital root sequence cycles of all three twin prime distribution channels (namely numbers ≌ to {11,13}, {17,19} and {1,29} modulo 30).\n- This is also true of dyads formed by ***paired radii of the Prime Spiral Sieve that sum to 30***, i.e., numbers ≌ to {1,29}, {7,23}, {11,19}, or {13,17} modulo 30, as well as dyads formed when {n, n + 10} are ≌ to {1, 11}, {7, 17}, {13, 23} or {19, 29} modulo 30 (note their pairing by terminating digits). One example relating to twin primes: The first three candidate pairs in the twin prime distribution channel ≌ to {11,13} modulo 30 (all three of which are indeed twin primes) sequence their digital roots as follows:\n  - **{11,13} = digital roots 2 &amp; 4**\n  - **{41,43} = digital roots 5 &amp; 7**\n  - **{71,73} = digital roots 8 &amp; 1**.\n- As you can see, this is the same digital root sequence illustrated above. It appears that the triangulations and magic squares structuring the distribution of twin primes (and as it turns out, all prime numbers) have a genesis in universal principles involving symmetry groups ***rotated by the 8-dimensional algorithms*** discussed at length on this site.\n- You can see this universal principle at work, for example, with regard to the Fibonacci digital root sequence when coupled to a pair of dyads that follow certain incremental rules. As we illustrated above, the initializing dyad of ***the period-24 Fibonacci digital root sequence*** is {1,1, ...}.\n\nWe can generate triangles and magic squares by tiering the Fibonacci digital root sequence with two pairs of terms that are + 3 or + 6 from the initial terms {1,1}. The values of the 2nd and 3rd tiers, or rows, must differ, or symmetry is lost.

We've dubbed this object a 'palindromagon' given that the coordinates of the 18 triangulations produced by the digital root dyadic cycles in the order sequenced sum to a palindrome: 639 693 963 369 396 936.\n- Remarkably, this periodic palindrome, with additive sum of 108, sequences the 6 possible permutations of values {3,6,9}. Interesting to consider a geometric object with a hidden palindromic dimension. But that's not all: When the six triadic permutations forming the palindrome are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in the order generated, ACE and BDF form 3 x 3 Latin squares.

And this 30th order repeats itself to infinity. Even in the first 30s system, therefore, the positions are fixed in which the number information positions itself to infinity. We call it the first member of the MEC 30.\n- The numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 are highlighted. We call them prime positions, hence 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Important for our work is that in the following the term prime refers only to prime numbers that are in the prime positions. So primes 2, 3 and 5 are always excluded.\n- These positions: 1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29. We refer to this basic system as MEC 30 - \"Mathematical Elementary Cell 30\". By repeating the positions we show the function of the basic system in the next step. If we extend the 30th order of the MEC, for example, to the number 120, the result is ***4 times a 30th order*** and thus 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions.\n- Hypothetical assumption: If the product of the primes (except 2, 3, 5,) would not fall into the prime positions, thus be divided by 2, 3 or 5, the information would have 120 = 32 primes in 32 prime positions: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, / 61, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 89, / 91, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119\n- These forms gives prime positions:  1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17 , 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The 30th order is repeated in the number space ***120 = 4 times, 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions, thus 4 terms***.\n\nFrom our consideration we can conclude that the distribution of prime numbers must have a static base structure, which is also confirmed logically in the further course. This static structure is altered by the products of the primes themselves, since these products must fall into the prime positions since they are not divisible by 2, 3 and 5. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en#similarDocuments))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Speaking of iterative digital division–a powerful tool for exposing structure–we get this astonishing equation: iteratively dividing the digital roots of the first 12 Fibonacci numbers times the divisively iterated 1000th prime, 7919, times 3604 gives us 1000.

Also, the sum of the multiplicative digital roots = 108 x 24 = 2592 = 432 x 6.\n- Note: Channels A, D, E and F combined represent the set of natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 and 5, the first 24 elements of which form the basis of the [Magic Mirror Matrix](https://www.primesdemystified.com/magicmatrix.html).\n- The graphic below illustrates the transformative relationships between the matrices employing their primary building blocks (one of the sixteen identical 6 x 6 (36 element) Latin Squares that constitute each matrix)\n- When you rotate either the {1,4,7} or {2,5,8} magic square around its horizontal axis, i.e. columns {A,B,C} become {C,B,A}, then add the {1,4,7} {2,5,8} magic squares together, you produce a square with nine 9's. For example, ***adding the first rows of each gives us: {2,8,5} + {7,1,4} = {9,9,9}***.\n- Triangles and magic squares similar–or identical–to those shown above can be derived from the digital root sequence cycles of all three twin prime distribution channels (namely numbers ≌ to {11,13}, {17,19} and {1,29} modulo 30).\n- This is also true of dyads formed by ***paired radii of the Prime Spiral Sieve that sum to 30***, i.e., numbers ≌ to {1,29}, {7,23}, {11,19}, or {13,17} modulo 30, as well as dyads formed when {n, n + 10} are ≌ to {1, 11}, {7, 17}, {13, 23} or {19, 29} modulo 30 (note their pairing by terminating digits). One example relating to twin primes: The first three candidate pairs in the twin prime distribution channel ≌ to {11,13} modulo 30 (all three of which are indeed twin primes) sequence their digital roots as follows:\n  - **{11,13} = digital roots 2 &amp; 4**\n  - **{41,43} = digital roots 5 &amp; 7**\n  - **{71,73} = digital roots 8 &amp; 1**.\n- As you can see, this is the same digital root sequence illustrated above. It appears that the triangulations and magic squares structuring the distribution of twin primes (and as it turns out, all prime numbers) have a genesis in universal principles involving symmetry groups ***rotated by the 8-dimensional algorithms*** discussed at length on this site.\n- You can see this universal principle at work, for example, with regard to the Fibonacci digital root sequence when coupled to a pair of dyads that follow certain incremental rules. As we illustrated above, the initializing dyad of ***the period-24 Fibonacci digital root sequence*** is {1,1, ...}.\n\nWe can generate triangles and magic squares by tiering the Fibonacci digital root sequence with two pairs of terms that are + 3 or + 6 from the initial terms {1,1}. The values of the 2nd and 3rd tiers, or rows, must differ, or symmetry is lost. In other words, ***the first two columns should read either {1,4,7 + 1,7,4, or vice versa} but not {1,4,7 + 1,4,7, or 1,7,4, + 1,7,4}***. _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/twinprimes.html))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.primesdemystified.com/twinprimes.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/2b8e8a2b-4bbd-4562-a907-9cad0dc61f76\" alt=\"Multiplication_Matrix_Transforms\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The above seven (7) primes will act then as <strong><em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane\">extended branes</a></em></strong>.

We've dubbed this object a 'palindromagon' given that the coordinates of the 18 triangulations produced by the digital root dyadic cycles in the order sequenced sum to a palindrome: 639 693 963 369 396 936.\n- Remarkably, this periodic palindrome, with additive sum of 108, sequences the 6 possible permutations of values {3,6,9}. Interesting to consider a geometric object with a hidden palindromic dimension. But that's not all: When the six triadic permutations forming the palindrome are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in the order generated, ACE and BDF form 3 x 3 Latin squares.

BDF***\n  - 693 ... 639\n  - 369 ... 963\n  - 936 ... 396\n\n- The output of these algorithmically sequenced triangulations is fundamentally a geometric representation of the twin prime distribution channels (and, as we noted above, the same geometry is expressed in factorization sequencing, albeit the vertices may be ordered differently.\n- This is because each set of three generator dyads roots to the same six elements: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. Thus, for example, dyad sets ({1,2} {4,5} {7,8}) and ({2,4} {5,7} {8,1}) will generate identical complex polygons, despite their vertices being sequenced in different orders.).\n\nIt's remarkable that ***objects consisting of star polygons, spiraling irregular pentagons***, and possessing nonagon perimeters and centers, can be constructed from only ***27 coordinates pointing to 9 triangles in 3 variations***.

However, if one makes a significant and interesting assumption, then 1 and 0 fall in their logical locations – in the 1 and 0 cells, respectively. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/0-1-and-negative-numbers/))\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>0 + 30 + 36 + 102 = 168 = π(1000)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hexspin.com/0-1-and-negative-numbers/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/19f68eca-c0e1-48fc-9c9a-60d01cf26057\" alt=\"0, 1 and negative numbers\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Because the value 30 is the first (common) product of the first 3 primes. And this 30th order repeats itself to infinity. Even in the first 30s system, therefore, the positions are fixed in which the number information positions itself to infinity. We call it the first member of the MEC 30.\n- The numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 are highlighted. We call them prime positions, hence 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Important for our work is that in the following the term prime refers only to prime numbers that are in the prime positions. So primes 2, 3 and 5 are always excluded.\n- These positions: 1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29. We refer to this basic system as MEC 30 - \"Mathematical Elementary Cell 30\". By repeating the positions we show the function of the basic system in the next step. If we extend the 30th order of the MEC, for example, to the number 120, the result is ***4 times a 30th order*** and thus 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions.\n- Hypothetical assumption: If the product of the primes (except 2, 3, 5,) would not fall into the prime positions, thus be divided by 2, 3 or 5, the information would have 120 = 32 primes in 32 prime positions: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, / 61, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 89, / 91, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119\n- These forms gives prime positions:  1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17 , 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The 30th order is repeated in the number space ***120 = 4 times, 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions, thus 4 terms***.\n\nFrom our consideration we can conclude that the distribution of prime numbers must have a static base structure, which is also confirmed logically in the further course. This static structure is altered by the products of the primes themselves, since these products must fall into the prime positions since they are not divisible by 2, 3 and 5. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en#similarDocuments))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Speaking of iterative digital division–a powerful tool for exposing structure–we get this astonishing equation: iteratively dividing the digital roots of the first 12 Fibonacci numbers times the divisively iterated 1000th prime, 7919, times 3604 gives us 1000.

Thirty is the largest integer with this property.]\n- The integer 30, product of the first three prime numbers (2, 3 and 5), and thus a primorial, plays a powerful role organizing the array's perfect symmetry, viz., in the case of the 8 prime roots:\n\n1+29=30; 7+23=30; 11+19=30; and 13+17=30.\n\n- In The Number Mysteries well-known mathematician Marcus Du Sautoy writes: \"In the world of mathematics, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are like hydrogen, helium, and lithium. That's what makes them the most important numbers in mathematics.\"\n- Although 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime numbers not included in the domain under discussion, they are nonetheless integral to it: First of all, they sieve out roughly 73% of all natural numbers, leaving only those nominally necessary to construct a geometry within which prime numbers can be optimally arrayed.\n- The remaining 26.66% (to be a bit more precise) constituting the array can be constructed with an elegantly simple interchangeable expression (or power series, if you prefer) that incorporates the first three primes. It's conjectured that this manifold series ultimately consists of all (and only) the numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (and their negatives), which inclues all prime numbers &gt;5 (more below under the heading \"Conjectures and Facts Relating to the Prime Spiral Sieve\").\n\nWhat is critical to understand, is that the invisible hand of 2, 3 and 5, and their factorial 30, create the structure within which the balance of the prime numbers, i.e., all those greater than 5, are arrayed algorithmically–as we shall demonstrate. Primes 2, 3 and 5 play out in modulo 30-60-90 cycles (decomposing to {3,6,9} sequencing at the digital root level). Once the role of 2, 3 and 5 is properly understood, all else falls beautifully into place. _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/#Distribution_of_Perfect_Squares))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/31cec66a-566f-466d-9ea6-f924e7499f01\" alt=\"One_Grand_Pyramid_Teaser\" /></a></p>\n\n","dir":"/addition/spin1/","name":"README.md","path":"addition/spin1/README.md","url":"/addition/spin1/"},{"sort":2,"spin":2,"span":null,"suit":2,"description":null,"permalink":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin1/","layout":"default","title":"True Prime Pairs","content":"<h1 id=\"true-prime-pairs\">True Prime Pairs</h1>\n\n<p>This is the partial of <em><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831\">the mapping scheme</a></em> of our <a href=\"https://github.com/eq19\">eQuantum Project</a>.

Thirty is the largest integer with this property.]\n- The integer 30, product of the first three prime numbers (2, 3 and 5), and thus a primorial, plays a powerful role organizing the array's perfect symmetry, viz., in the case of the 8 prime roots:\n\n1+29=30; 7+23=30; 11+19=30; and 13+17=30.\n\n- In The Number Mysteries well-known mathematician Marcus Du Sautoy writes: \"In the world of mathematics, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are like hydrogen, helium, and lithium. That's what makes them the most important numbers in mathematics.\"\n- Although 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime numbers not included in the domain under discussion, they are nonetheless integral to it: First of all, they sieve out roughly 73% of all natural numbers, leaving only those nominally necessary to construct a geometry within which prime numbers can be optimally arrayed.\n- The remaining 26.66% (to be a bit more precise) constituting the array can be constructed with an elegantly simple interchangeable expression (or power series, if you prefer) that incorporates the first three primes. It's conjectured that this manifold series ultimately consists of all (and only) the numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (and their negatives), which inclues all prime numbers &gt;5 (more below under the heading \"Conjectures and Facts Relating to the Prime Spiral Sieve\").\n\nWhat is critical to understand, is that the invisible hand of 2, 3 and 5, and their factorial 30, create the structure within which the balance of the prime numbers, i.e., all those greater than 5, are arrayed algorithmically–as we shall demonstrate. Primes 2, 3 and 5 play out in modulo 30-60-90 cycles (decomposing to {3,6,9} sequencing at the digital root level). Once the role of 2, 3 and 5 is properly understood, all else falls beautifully into place. _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/#Distribution_of_Perfect_Squares))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/31cec66a-566f-466d-9ea6-f924e7499f01\" alt=\"One_Grand_Pyramid_Teaser\" /></a></p>\n\n","dir":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin1/","name":"README.md","path":"exponentiation/span13/addition/spin1/README.md","url":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin1/"},{"sort":3,"spin":3,"span":null,"suit":3,"description":null,"permalink":"/addition/spin2/","layout":"default","title":"Primes Platform","content":"<h1 id=\"primes-platform\">Primes Platform</h1>\n\n<p>We analyze the inference process of dynamic and observe that the dynamic tensor shapes and control flow hinder by prime numbers</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">This section is referring to _[wiki page-3](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ of _[zone section-3]()_ that is _[inherited ](/syntax)_ from _[the zone section-3](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_ by _[prime spin-3](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#file-spin-csv)_ and _[span-](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#basic-transformation)_ with _[the partitions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#parallel-universes)_ as below.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>/syntax</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17277693/s11390-021-1161-y.pdf\">this paper</a> for a discussion of the challenges imposed by dynamic shapes and one project’s approach to addressing them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-shapes\">Dynamic Shapes</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fQL4KRH3wUQ\">Prime hexagon</a> is a mathematical structure that is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This is not easy as they are linked to the nature of prime numbers, and nothing is easy about the nature of prime numbers.

That every even number should consist of the sum of two primes.\n- All pairs of prime numbers without \"1\", 2, 3, 5, we call henceforth Goldbach pairs. The MEC 30 transforms this idea of Christian Goldbach into the structure of a numerical double-strand, into an opposing member of the MEC 30 scale.\n- We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in 8 prime pairs.\n- In this case, among the 8 pairs of prime pairs there are only 6 Goldbach pairs. 2 prime positions in the prime position pairs carry products of the factors \"1 × 1\" and 7 × 7. Thus, 2 prime pairs do not fulfill the requirements of the Goldbach pairs. In general, any even number larger than 30 can be represented graphically within a cycle (MEC 30) as a specific cyclic convolution. This characteristic convolution of the even numbers is a fundamental test element in the numerical table. The result Even the even numbers to infinity occupy a fixed position within the 30s system MEC 30. The even numbers thus have 15 positions: 30/2 = 15 even positions of the MEC 30.\n- There are therefore only 15 even positions for all even numbers to infinity. Every even number has a specific convolution due to its position in the 30s system.

The information of the prime number products translates our theory into a checkerboard-like pattern using the finite 8 prime positions from the MEC 30, we call it Ikon. 8 × 8 primary positions = 64 primary positions of the checkerboard icon.\n- First, there are two main features that we use. To Ikon 1: The primes information and their products. In this left icon, the redundants (the doubles) are to be determined through the number information in the positions Impeccable.\n- Second: The product positions. In the icon, the cyclic behavior is shown in identical 8 horizontal and 8 vertical orders, we call these orders templates that would not be visible through the pure number information. The cyclical behavior of the 8 × 8 product positions continues indefinitely.\n- Since the prime positions are finite, a total of 8 positions in the 30th order, an already revolutionary system opens up, the entire infinite distribution of the prime number products in an icon as a \"checkerboard pattern\". represent and thus obtain mathematically exact results.\n- The three and 4 , Square Graphics (Ikon) will now be in the following, larger graphic 5 transfer. As stated above, we use the properties of the numbers, they consist of one information and one position. Thus we are able to calculate the redundant product positions by means of identical information in different positions.\n- And subtracting them from the total prime positions gives us the number of prime numbers. This succeeds due to the self-similarity of the 30th order of the MEC 30, as shown in the graph 5 is articulated. At the top of the following larger graphic 5 the self-similarity of the 30th order (MEC 30) can be seen.\n- This results in a fundamental causal relation to the primes, systemically the products are entered into the position system. Therefore, the distribution of primes products also determines the distribution of primes themselves. The reason lies in the one-system, since the prime number as a number itself also consists of an information and a position.\n\nWe apply the same principle as above for the determination of the prime position. Only with the difference that we move in the even positions of the MEC 30.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>7 x π(89) = 7 x 24 = 168 = π(1000)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/244855108-b80b3c2e-1a13-4b55-828a-72ed15b448dd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.primesdemystified.com/Factorization.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6e26ada0-c545-4771-810b-9f721512a03c\" alt=\"Theory of Everything\" /></a></p>\n","dir":"/addition/spin2/","name":"README.md","path":"addition/spin2/README.md","url":"/addition/spin2/"},{"sort":3,"spin":3,"span":null,"suit":3,"description":null,"permalink":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin2/","layout":"default","title":"Primes Platform","content":"<h1 id=\"primes-platform\">Primes Platform</h1>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">This section is referring to _[wiki page-3](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ of _[zone section-3]()_ that is _[inherited ](/syntax)_ from _[the zone section-3](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_ by _[prime spin-3](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#file-spin-csv)_ and _[span-](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#basic-transformation)_ with _[the partitions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#parallel-universes)_ as below.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>/syntax</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hexspin.com/\">Prime hexagon</a> is a mathematical structure developed by mathematician T.

That every even number should consist of the sum of two primes.\n- All pairs of prime numbers without \"1\", 2, 3, 5, we call henceforth Goldbach pairs. The MEC 30 transforms this idea of Christian Goldbach into the structure of a numerical double-strand, into an opposing member of the MEC 30 scale.\n- We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in 8 prime pairs.\n- In this case, among the 8 pairs of prime pairs there are only 6 Goldbach pairs. 2 prime positions in the prime position pairs carry products of the factors \"1 × 1\" and 7 × 7. Thus, 2 prime pairs do not fulfill the requirements of the Goldbach pairs. In general, any even number larger than 30 can be represented graphically within a cycle (MEC 30) as a specific cyclic convolution. This characteristic convolution of the even numbers is a fundamental test element in the numerical table. The result Even the even numbers to infinity occupy a fixed position within the 30s system MEC 30. The even numbers thus have 15 positions: 30/2 = 15 even positions of the MEC 30.\n- There are therefore only 15 even positions for all even numbers to infinity. Every even number has a specific convolution due to its position in the 30s system. First, we have to determine the positions of the even numbers in the 30s system to make them one in the following graph 7 attributable to the 15 specific folds.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74591945-2b75cb80-504f-11ea-85dd-14d0a803ee6b.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">p r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61 ✔️\n3 2 0 1 0 2\n4 3 1 1 0 3\n5 5 2 1 0 5\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49 ✔️\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43 ✔️\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36  👉 7s\n-----\n</code></pre>  \n\n<h2 id=\"palindromic-sequence\">Palindromic Sequence</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In the matrix pictured below, we list the first 24 elements of our domain, take their squares, calculate the modulo 90 congruence and digital roots of each square, and display the digital root factorization dyad for each square (and map their ***collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry***). _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>7 x π(89) = 7 x 24 = 168 = π(1000)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#elementary-structure\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200229388-03811f48-2492-4845-b15f-85259cd93717.png\" alt=\"collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">p r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61\n3 2 0 1 0 2 👉 2 ✔️\n4 3 1 1 0 3 👉 61 - 1 = 60 ✔️\n5 5 2 1 0 5\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36  👉 7s\n-----\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The color spin addresses for numbers are generally straightforward – a composite number takes the spin of the prior prime.  4 spins blue because 3 spins blue.  8 is red because 7 is red.

The information of the prime number products translates our theory into a checkerboard-like pattern using the finite 8 prime positions from the MEC 30, we call it Ikon. 8 × 8 primary positions = 64 primary positions of the checkerboard icon.\n- First, there are two main features that we use. To Ikon 1: The primes information and their products. In this left icon, the redundants (the doubles) are to be determined through the number information in the positions Impeccable.\n- Second: The product positions. In the icon, the cyclic behavior is shown in identical 8 horizontal and 8 vertical orders, we call these orders templates that would not be visible through the pure number information. The cyclical behavior of the 8 × 8 product positions continues indefinitely.\n- Since the prime positions are finite, a total of 8 positions in the 30th order, an already revolutionary system opens up, the entire infinite distribution of the prime number products in an icon as a \"checkerboard pattern\". represent and thus obtain mathematically exact results.\n- The three and 4 , Square Graphics (Ikon) will now be in the following, larger graphic 5 transfer. As stated above, we use the properties of the numbers, they consist of one information and one position. Thus we are able to calculate the redundant product positions by means of identical information in different positions.\n- And subtracting them from the total prime positions gives us the number of prime numbers. This succeeds due to the self-similarity of the 30th order of the MEC 30, as shown in the graph 5 is articulated. At the top of the following larger graphic 5 the self-similarity of the 30th order (MEC 30) can be seen.\n- This results in a fundamental causal relation to the primes, systemically the products are entered into the position system. Therefore, the distribution of primes products also determines the distribution of primes themselves. The reason lies in the one-system, since the prime number as a number itself also consists of an information and a position.\n\nWe apply the same principle as above for the determination of the prime position. Only with the difference that we move in the even positions of the MEC 30.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>7 x π(89) = 7 x 24 = 168 = π(1000)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/244855108-b80b3c2e-1a13-4b55-828a-72ed15b448dd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.primesdemystified.com/Factorization.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6e26ada0-c545-4771-810b-9f721512a03c\" alt=\"Theory of Everything\" /></a></p>\n","dir":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin2/","name":"README.md","path":"exponentiation/span13/addition/spin2/README.md","url":"/exponentiation/span13/addition/spin2/"},{"sort":4,"spin":5,"span":null,"suit":7,"description":null,"permalink":"/addition/spin3/","layout":"default","title":"Pairwise Scenario","content":"<h1 id=\"pairwise-scenario\">Pairwise Scenario</h1>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">This section is referring to _[wiki page-4](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/wiki)_ of _[zone section-4]()_ that is _[inherited ](/syntax)_ from _[the zone section-7](https://gist.github.com/eq19)_ by _[prime spin-5](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#file-spin-csv)_ and _[span-](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#basic-transformation)_ with _[the partitions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#parallel-universes)_ as below.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>/syntax</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a4e57e16-8334-4270-bce7-9739e30df21a\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>(10 - 2) th prime = 8th prime = 19</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-implementation\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200228711-996e52bf-887c-445d-ad4b-46da2eabc30e.png\" alt=\"default\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The subclasses of partitions systemically develops characters similar to the distribution of prime numbers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/227838045-3ddd5238-7beb-4023-affa-c61a054afd2b.png\" alt=\"Rank of a partition\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>tps://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#partition-function) represents the number of possible partitions of a non-negative integer n.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>f(8 twins) = 60 - 23 = 37 inner partitions</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">p r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61\n3 2 0 1 0 2 👉 2\n4 3 1 1 0 3 👉 89 -29 = 61 - 1 = 60 ✔️\n5 5 2 1 0 5 👉 f(37) = f(8 twins) ✔️\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36  👉 7s\n-----\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>7 + 13 + 19 + 25 = 64 = 8 × 8 = 8²</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/83051968-e2cfa480-a078-11ea-8ff2-316a809a8fad.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"subclasses-of-partitions\">Subclasses of Partitions</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Let weighted points be given in the plane .

A key distinction between the two families is that fermions obey the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle): that is, there cannot be two identical fermions simultaneously having the same quantum numbers (meaning, roughly, having the same position, velocity and spin direction).

[Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson). [Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) have half-integer spin while [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) have integer spin.\n- Bosons are characterized by Bose–Einstein statistics and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.\n- The Higgs boson is postulated by the electroweak theory primarily to explain the origin of particle masses. In a process known as the \"Higgs mechanism\", the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry.\n- The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 127 GeV/c2 was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson. Since then, the particle has been shown to behave, interact, and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model, as well as having even parity and zero spin, two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson.\n- This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature. Elementary bosons responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). Strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons.\n\nAccording to the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model_of_Particle_Physics) ***there are five (5) elementary bosons***:\n- One (1) [scalar boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_boson) (***spin = 0***) \n [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) – the particle that contributes to the phenomenon of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) via the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism)\n- Four (4) [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) (***spin = 1***) that act as [force carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carriers).\n\n[![IMG_20240108_033415](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/044cb15e-36d7-4b44-aace-818a6d415917)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_particles)\n\nThese four are the [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson):\n- [γ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) [Photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) – the force carrier of the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field)\n- [g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) [Gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) (***eight (8) different types***) – force carriers that mediate the [strong force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction)\n- [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_boson) [Neutral weak boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) – the force carrier that mediates the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction)\n- [W±](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_boson) [Charged weak bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) (***two (2)types***) – force carriers that mediate the weak force\n\nA second order tensor boson (***spin = 2***) called the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) (G) has been hypothesised as the force carrier for [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_force), but so far all attempts to incorporate gravity into the Standard Model have failed.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13793234/the-physics-of-the-standard-model-and-beyond.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/770d6abc-86d1-4195-b102-53e18fca3c10\" alt=\"Beyond the standard model\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The diagram shows the elementary particles of the Standard Model (the Higgs boson, the three generations of quarks and leptons, and the gauge bosons), including their names, masses, spins, charges, chiralities, and interactions with the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces.

[Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson). [Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) have half-integer spin while [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) have integer spin.\n- Bosons are characterized by Bose–Einstein statistics and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.\n- The Higgs boson is postulated by the electroweak theory primarily to explain the origin of particle masses. In a process known as the \"Higgs mechanism\", the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry.\n- The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 127 GeV/c2 was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson. Since then, the particle has been shown to behave, interact, and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model, as well as having even parity and zero spin, two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson.\n- This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature. Elementary bosons responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons).

These are based on symmetries of toroidally reduced supergravity; however are defined on a general background.\n- From the point of view of ExFT the toroidal background is a maximally symmetric solution preserving all U-duality symmetries. In this sense the approach is similar to the embedding tensor technique, which is used to define gauge supergravity in a covariant and supersymmetry invariant form. Although any particular choice of gauging breaks certain amount of supersymmetry, the formalism itself is completely invariant. Similarly the U-duality covariant approach is transferred to dynamics of branes in both string and M-theory, whose construction has not been covered here.\n- In the text, we described construction of the field content of exceptional field theories from fields of dimensionally reduced 11-dimensional supergravity, and local and global symmetries of the theories. Various solutions of the section constraint giving Type IIA/B, 11D and lower-dimensional gauged supergravities have been discussed without going deep into technical details. For readers’ convenience references for the original works are present.\n- As a formalism exceptional field theory has found essential number of application, some of which have been described in this review in more details. In particular, we have covered generalized twist reductions of ExFTs, which reproduce lower-dimensional gauged supergravities, description of non-geometric brane backgrounds and an algorithm for generating deformations of supergravity backgrounds based on frame change inside DFT.

Based on the idea of stable, knotted vortices in the ether or [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_theories), it contributed an important mathematical legacy.\n- The vortex theory of the atom was based on the observation that a stable [vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) can be created in a fluid by making it into a ring with no ends. Such vortices could be sustained in the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether), a hypothetical fluid thought at the time to pervade all of space. In the vortex theory of the [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom), a chemical atom is modelled by such a vortex in the aether.\n- Knots can be tied in the core of such a vortex, leading to the hypothesis that each [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) corresponds to a different kind of knot. The simple [toroidal vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_vortex), represented by the circular \"unknot\" 01, was thought to represent [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen). Many elements had yet to be discovered, so the next knot, the [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot) 31, was thought to represent [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon).\n\nHowever, as more elements were discovered and the periodicity of their characteristics established in the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) of the elements, it became clear that this could not be explained by any rational classification of knots. This, together with the discovery of subatomic particles such as the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron), led to the theory being abandoned. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72685907-2f323300-3b21-11ea-934b-43e314157988.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72666121-b7410b80-3a41-11ea-9217-b37f485d5098.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Since we are discussing about prime distribution then this 18’s structure will also cover the further scheme that is inherited from the above 37 files.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This web enabled demonstration shows a polar plot of ***the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points) along the critical line Zeta(1/2+it) for real values of t running from 0 to 50***.

These are based on symmetries of toroidally reduced supergravity; however are defined on a general background.\n- From the point of view of ExFT the toroidal background is a maximally symmetric solution preserving all U-duality symmetries. In this sense the approach is similar to the embedding tensor technique, which is used to define gauge supergravity in a covariant and supersymmetry invariant form. Although any particular choice of gauging breaks certain amount of supersymmetry, the formalism itself is completely invariant. Similarly the U-duality covariant approach is transferred to dynamics of branes in both string and M-theory, whose construction has not been covered here.\n- In the text, we described construction of the field content of exceptional field theories from fields of dimensionally reduced 11-dimensional supergravity, and local and global symmetries of the theories. Various solutions of the section constraint giving Type IIA/B, 11D and lower-dimensional gauged supergravities have been discussed without going deep into technical details. For readers’ convenience references for the original works are present.\n- As a formalism exceptional field theory has found essential number of application, some of which have been described in this review in more details. In particular, we have covered generalized twist reductions of ExFTs, which reproduce lower-dimensional gauged supergravities, description of non-geometric brane backgrounds and an algorithm for generating deformations of supergravity backgrounds based on frame change inside DFT.

Based on the idea of stable, knotted vortices in the ether or [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_theories), it contributed an important mathematical legacy.\n- The vortex theory of the atom was based on the observation that a stable [vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) can be created in a fluid by making it into a ring with no ends. Such vortices could be sustained in the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether), a hypothetical fluid thought at the time to pervade all of space. In the vortex theory of the [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom), a chemical atom is modelled by such a vortex in the aether.\n- Knots can be tied in the core of such a vortex, leading to the hypothesis that each [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) corresponds to a different kind of knot. The simple [toroidal vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_vortex), represented by the circular \"unknot\" 01, was thought to represent [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen). Many elements had yet to be discovered, so the next knot, the [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot) 31, was thought to represent [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon).\n\nHowever, as more elements were discovered and the periodicity of their characteristics established in the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) of the elements, it became clear that this could not be explained by any rational classification of knots. This, together with the discovery of subatomic particles such as the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron), led to the theory being abandoned. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72685907-2f323300-3b21-11ea-934b-43e314157988.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72666121-b7410b80-3a41-11ea-9217-b37f485d5098.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Since we are discussing about prime distribution then this 18’s structure will also cover the further scheme that is inherited from the above 37 files.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This web enabled demonstration shows a polar plot of ***the first 20 non-trivial Riemann zeta function zeros (including Gram points) along the critical line Zeta(1/2+it) for real values of t running from 0 to 50***.

The gram suffix derives from γραμμῆ (grammē) meaning a line.\n- A regular enneagram is a 9-sided [star polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon). It is constructed using the same points as the regular [enneagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagon), but the points are connected in fixed steps.\n- Two forms of regular enneagram exist:\n  - One form connects every second point and is represented by the [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) {9/2}.\n  - The other form connects every fourth point and is represented by the Schläfli symbol {9/4}.\n- There is also a star figure, {9/3} or 3{3}, made from the regular enneagon points but connected as a compound of three equilateral triangles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-4) (If the triangles are alternately interlaced, this results in a [Brunnian link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunnian_link).)\n- From this perspective, there are twenty-seven (27) distinct [personality patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Instinctual_subtypes), because people of each of the nine (9) types also express themselves as one of the three (3) subtypes.\n\nThis star figure is sometimes known as the star of [Goliath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath), after [{6/2} or 2{3}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram), the star of [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-5)  _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=the+seventh+enneagram&amp;tbm=isch\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72740943-43d20200-3bd9-11ea-9a57-49516138a23f.jpg\" alt=\"The Seventh Enneagram\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n|--------------- 7¤ ---------------|\n|-------------- {89} --------------|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n|  5 |  7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 |{18}| 18 | 12 |{13}|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n                         |---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|---- {43} ----|\n                         |----- 3¤ -----|----- 3¤ -----|----- 3¤ -----|\n                         |-------------------- 9¤ --------------------|\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Vortex Based Mathematics transcends our myopic quantitative understanding for the way Number operates in our holographic universe.

Those points are equivalent to magnetic monopoles in the momentum space and are connected by Fermi arcs.\n- A combination of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), modelling, density functional theory and careful calculations were used to confirm the existence of this new type of Weyl semimetal. This material provides an exciting new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions, and may lead the way to more new materials with unusual transport properties.\n\n“This an important, interdisciplinary discovery because it allows us to study many aspects of these exotic particles predicted by high energy physics theory in solid state, without need for extremely expensive particle accelerators,” said Adam Kaminsky, Ames Laboratory scientist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. “From my perspective as solid state physicist it is absolutely extraordinary to observe two bands touching each other at certain points and being connected by Fermi arcs – objects that are prohibited to exist in “ordinary” materials.” _([rdworldonline.com](https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/d95795e8-1d97-49ce-b256-fa8df87748e2\" alt=\"rd1608_fermion\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>7 + 11 + 13 = 31</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n    |-------------------------------- 2x96 -------------------------------|\n❓  |--------------- 7¤ ---------------|------------ 7¤ ------------------|\n〰️43👉------------- {89} --------------|{12}|-- {30} -|-- {36} -|-- {25} -|\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n    |  5 |  7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 12 | 13 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n    |--------- {53} ---------|---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|---- {43} ----👉89〰️\n    |---------- 5¤ ----------|------------ {96} -----------|----- 3¤ -----|   ❓\n    |-------- Bosons --------|---------- Fermions ---------|-- Gravitons--|\n          13 variations               48 variations          11 variations \n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This proposition was first demonstrated by Edwin Hubble (1889-1953).

It is sometimes called a nonagram, nonangle, or enneagon.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-1)\n\nThe word 'enneagram' combines the [numeral prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix) [ennea-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ennea-) with the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) suffix [-gram](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-gram). The gram suffix derives from γραμμῆ (grammē) meaning a line.\n- A regular enneagram is a 9-sided [star polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon). It is constructed using the same points as the regular [enneagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagon), but the points are connected in fixed steps.\n- Two forms of regular enneagram exist:\n  - One form connects every second point and is represented by the [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) {9/2}.\n  - The other form connects every fourth point and is represented by the Schläfli symbol {9/4}.\n- There is also a star figure, {9/3} or 3{3}, made from the regular enneagon points but connected as a compound of three equilateral triangles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-4) (If the triangles are alternately interlaced, this results in a [Brunnian link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunnian_link).)\n- From this perspective, there are twenty-seven (27) distinct [personality patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Instinctual_subtypes), because people of each of the nine (9) types also express themselves as one of the three (3) subtypes.\n\nThis star figure is sometimes known as the star of [Goliath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath), after [{6/2} or 2{3}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram), the star of [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)#cite_note-5)  _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_(geometry)))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=the+seventh+enneagram&amp;tbm=isch\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72740943-43d20200-3bd9-11ea-9a57-49516138a23f.jpg\" alt=\"The Seventh Enneagram\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n|--------------- 7¤ ---------------|\n|-------------- {89} --------------|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n|  5 |  7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 |{18}| 18 | 12 |{13}|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n                         |---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|---- {43} ----|\n                         |----- 3¤ -----|----- 3¤ -----|----- 3¤ -----|\n                         |-------------------- 9¤ --------------------|\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Vortex Based Mathematics transcends our myopic quantitative understanding for the way Number operates in our holographic universe.

This material provides an exciting new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions, and may lead the way to more new materials with unusual transport properties.\n\n“This an important, interdisciplinary discovery because it allows us to study many aspects of these exotic particles predicted by high energy physics theory in solid state, without need for extremely expensive particle accelerators,” said Adam Kaminsky, Ames Laboratory scientist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. “From my perspective as solid state physicist it is absolutely extraordinary to observe two bands touching each other at certain points and being connected by Fermi arcs – objects that are prohibited to exist in “ordinary” materials.” _([rdworldonline.com](https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/d95795e8-1d97-49ce-b256-fa8df87748e2\" alt=\"rd1608_fermion\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>7 + 11 + 13 = 31</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n    |-------------------------------- 2x96 -------------------------------|\n❓  |--------------- 7¤ ---------------|------------ 7¤ ------------------|\n〰️43👉------------- {89} --------------|{12}|-- {30} -|-- {36} -|-- {25} -|\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n    |  5 |  7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 12 | 13 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n    |--------- {53} ---------|---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|---- {43} ----👉89〰️\n    |---------- 5¤ ----------|------------ {96} -----------|----- 3¤ -----|   ❓\n    |-------- Bosons --------|---------- Fermions ---------|-- Gravitons--|\n          13 variations               48 variations          11 variations \n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This proposition was first demonstrated by Edwin Hubble (1889-1953).

However, the Higgs has never been definitively observed (MHiggs &gt; 114 GeV at 95% CL [2]). \n- A Standard Model Higgs suffers from the so called hierarchy problem. The theory needs fine-tuned parameters to accomodate a light Higgs mass. Supersymmetry offers a solution to this problem, through a symmetry between fermions and bosons. \n- The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model  contains ***two Higgs doublets, leading to five physical Higgs bosons: Two neutral CP-even states (h and H), one neutral CP-odd (A), and two charged states (H+ and H~)***. \n- At tree-level, the masses are governed by two parameters, often taken to be mA and tan/3 [3]. When tan/3 &gt; &gt; 1 , ***A is nearly degenerate with one of the CP-even states (denoted φ)***. Where mA &lt; 130 GeV (mA &gt; 130), mA = mh (mA = mH).\n- In this same large tan/3 region, the cross sections for some production mechanisms such as pp -» Α(φ) and pp -» A($i)bb are enhanced by factors of tan /32(sec/32). For example, with Λ/S = 2 TeV, tan/3 = 30 and mA = 100 GeV, the cross sections for pp —&gt;· A and pp —&gt; φ are each of or-der 10 pb[4].\n- The cross section for pp -&gt; Α/φΜ) is smaller, but within the same order of magnitude. In the same region, the branching ratios to Α/φ -&gt;· bb and rr dominate, ***at ~ 90% and ~ 10%*** respectively, independent of mass. \n- Due to their similar masses, cross-sections and branching ratios in the high tan/3 region, we search for ***both A and φ simultaneously**$.\n- At the Tevatron, we search for pp —&gt;&gt; Α/φ —► rr (the bb final state is expected to be overwhelmed by dijet background) and pp -&gt;· Α/φΰ) -» bbbb. \n- This search for pp -&gt; Α/φ -&gt; r+r~ is underway at CDF. The dominant issues for this analysis are: ***[tau identification](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13852355/AndreaCardini-ICHEP2020-DeepTau.pdf), ditau mass reconstruction, irreducible background from Z —► rr, and event loss at the trigger level***. \n\nWherever not specified, we use the benchmark case of ***mA = 95 GeV and tan ß = 40*** to quote efficiencies and cross-sections. _([Search for MSSM Higgses at the Tevatron](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14056796/0212016.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>π(10) = 2,3,5,7</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b1d3bccd-a423-4ebb-a397-e973b2cc8e6e\" alt=\"SO(10)\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Sub  | i  |  β  | f   \n=======+====+=====+=======  ===   ===   ===   ===   ===   ===\n 1:1:0 | 1  |   1 | 2 {71}   1     1     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+-------  ---   ---    |     |     |     |\n 1:2:1 | 2  |   2 | 3 {71}         |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:2:2 | 3  |   3 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:3:3 | 4  |   4 |                |     |     |     |     |  \n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 1:3:4 | 5  |   5 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            9     1‘    |    Δ100   |\n*1:3:5 | 6  |   6 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:4:6 | 7  |   7 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 1:4:7 | 8  |   8 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:4:8 |{9} |   9 | 15 = 9 + 6 √   |     |     |     |     | ← 15 ✓\n=======+====+=====+====           ===   ===    1\"   ===    |\n*1:4:9 |{10}|  10 | 19 = 9 + 10 √  |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 2:1:0 | 11 |  20 | 20 = 19 + log 10 √   |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:2:1 | 12 |  30 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:2:2 | 13 |  40 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:3:3 | 14 |  50 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:3:4 | 15 |  60 |                      9‘    |   Δ200  Δ600\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:3:5 | 16 |  70 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:4:6 | 17 |  80 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:4:7 |{18}|  90 | 32 = 26 + 6 √        |     |     |     |← 32 = 31 + ∆1✓\n=======+====+=====+====                 ===   ===   ===    |\n*2:4:8 |{19}| 100 | 36 = 26 + 10 √       |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:4:9 | 20 | 200 | 38 = 36 + log 100 √        |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:1:0 | 21 | 300 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:2:1 | 22 | 400 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:2:2 | 23 | 500 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:3:3 | 24 | 600 |                            9\"  Δ300    |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:3:4 | 25 | 700 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:3:5 | 26 | 800 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:4:6 | 27 | 900 | 46 = 40 + 6 √              |     |     |← 46 = 45 + ∆1 ✓\n=======+====+=====+====                       ===   ===   ===\n 3:4:7 |{28}|1000 | 50 = 40 + 10 = 68 - 18 √\n</code></pre>  </div></div>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">[Valise adinkras](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/13248983/2110.01665.pdf), although an important subclass, do not encode all information present when a 4D supermultiplet is reduced to 1D.

If you visualized what was happening inside the proton as follows:\n  - a quark emits a gluon, changing its color,\n  - and that gluon is then absorbed by another quark, changing its color,\n\nyou’d get an excellent picture for what was happening with six of the possible gluons. _([Why are there only 8 gluons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/11/18/why-are-there-only-8-gluons/?sh=7d018fc67ad8))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toppr.com/ask/en-ch/question/how-many-types-of-quarks-are-there-and-what-are-their-names-404930-1/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a76f6747-e9bd-41d7-8204-f3251a196863\" alt=\"Why are there only 8 gluons?\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html\">another explanation</a> to the above <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge#:~:text=Gluons%20have%20a%20combination%20of,particles%20have%20zero%20color%20charge\">color charge</a> based on gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"triangular-wave\">Triangular Wave</h2>\n\n<p>One must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments so one of solution would be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07678\">truncated approach</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The first 3 triplets are prime and form the first triangle on top.

The BGY slides, the YBG matches the YBR except one letter.\n- Notice that the first 3 are prime. Then the next 4 are quite factorable. The 29 (RBR) is prime and there is no 29th letter, ending the pattern. 26 and 27 lead to 28 letters. Incidentally, the first 3 primes add to 99 and the primes add to 128. The last three to cover (RYY,YBY and RBR) match up with the top triangle’s bottom (except one letter) with RYY in reverse and make a matching triangle together. RYY has the most factors. The last 3 end in 29, suggesting an end to the pattern as there is no 29th letter.\n- The final letter is B and it matches the middle letter, the two letters at the top and the two letters at the bottom if we do the BGY slide in one way.\n\n***[Only B](https://allmynoodles.com/torah-geometry/)***.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://allmynoodles.com/torah-geometry/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/4dbd4199-685a-4a1a-a0f1-c6d9343349d7\" alt=\"a-triangle-sandwich-3\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Speculating beyond the pyramidal model just described, the ratios seem to suggest that this geometry can be conceived sinusoidally as a Fourier series forming continuous triangular waves that reverse polarity in quarter cycles.

The dominant issues for this analysis are: ***[tau identification](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13852355/AndreaCardini-ICHEP2020-DeepTau.pdf), ditau mass reconstruction, irreducible background from Z —► rr, and event loss at the trigger level***. \n\nWherever not specified, we use the benchmark case of ***mA = 95 GeV and tan ß = 40*** to quote efficiencies and cross-sections. _([Search for MSSM Higgses at the Tevatron](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14056796/0212016.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>π(10) = 2,3,5,7</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b1d3bccd-a423-4ebb-a397-e973b2cc8e6e\" alt=\"SO(10)\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Sub  | i  |  β  | f   \n=======+====+=====+=======  ===   ===   ===   ===   ===   ===\n 1:1:0 | 1  |   1 | 2 {71}   1     1     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+-------  ---   ---    |     |     |     |\n 1:2:1 | 2  |   2 | 3 {71}         |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:2:2 | 3  |   3 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:3:3 | 4  |   4 |                |     |     |     |     |  \n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 1:3:4 | 5  |   5 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            9     1‘    |    Δ100   |\n*1:3:5 | 6  |   6 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:4:6 | 7  |   7 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 1:4:7 | 8  |   8 |                |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n*1:4:8 |{9} |   9 | 15 = 9 + 6 √   |     |     |     |     | ← 15 ✓\n=======+====+=====+====           ===   ===    1\"   ===    |\n*1:4:9 |{10}|  10 | 19 = 9 + 10 √  |     |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----            |     |     |     |     |\n 2:1:0 | 11 |  20 | 20 = 19 + log 10 √   |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:2:1 | 12 |  30 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:2:2 | 13 |  40 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:3:3 | 14 |  50 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:3:4 | 15 |  60 |                      9‘    |   Δ200  Δ600\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:3:5 | 16 |  70 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:4:6 | 17 |  80 |                      |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n 2:4:7 |{18}|  90 | 32 = 26 + 6 √        |     |     |     |← 32 = 31 + ∆1✓\n=======+====+=====+====                 ===   ===   ===    |\n*2:4:8 |{19}| 100 | 36 = 26 + 10 √       |     |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                  |     |     |     |\n*2:4:9 | 20 | 200 | 38 = 36 + log 100 √        |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:1:0 | 21 | 300 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:2:1 | 22 | 400 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:2:2 | 23 | 500 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:3:3 | 24 | 600 |                            9\"  Δ300    |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n 3:3:4 | 25 | 700 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:3:5 | 26 | 800 |                            |     |     |\n-------+----+-----+----                        |     |     |\n*3:4:6 | 27 | 900 | 46 = 40 + 6 √              |     |     |← 46 = 45 + ∆1 ✓\n=======+====+=====+====                       ===   ===   ===\n 3:4:7 |{28}|1000 | 50 = 40 + 10 = 68 - 18 √\n</code></pre>  </div></div>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">[Valise adinkras](https://github.com/eq19/feed/files/13248983/2110.01665.pdf), although an important subclass, do not encode all information present when a 4D supermultiplet is reduced to 1D.

Indeed, this is what almost everyone expects, following some very straightforward logic.\n- There are three possible colors, three possible anticolors, and each possible color-anticolor combination represents one of the gluons. If you visualized what was happening inside the proton as follows:\n  - a quark emits a gluon, changing its color,\n  - and that gluon is then absorbed by another quark, changing its color,\n\nyou’d get an excellent picture for what was happening with six of the possible gluons. _([Why are there only 8 gluons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/11/18/why-are-there-only-8-gluons/?sh=7d018fc67ad8))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toppr.com/ask/en-ch/question/how-many-types-of-quarks-are-there-and-what-are-their-names-404930-1/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a76f6747-e9bd-41d7-8204-f3251a196863\" alt=\"Why are there only 8 gluons?\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html\">another explanation</a> to the above <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge#:~:text=Gluons%20have%20a%20combination%20of,particles%20have%20zero%20color%20charge\">color charge</a> based on gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"triangular-wave\">Triangular Wave</h2>\n\n<p>One must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments so one of solution would be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07678\">truncated approach</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The first 3 triplets are prime and form the first triangle on top. Then we do the next two and the last one on the bottom because we will sandwich the other 3 in.\n- These all match perfectly or one letter off on the bottom triangle, by sliding. The BGY slides, the YBG matches the YBR except one letter.\n- Notice that the first 3 are prime. Then the next 4 are quite factorable. The 29 (RBR) is prime and there is no 29th letter, ending the pattern. 26 and 27 lead to 28 letters. Incidentally, the first 3 primes add to 99 and the primes add to 128. The last three to cover (RYY,YBY and RBR) match up with the top triangle’s bottom (except one letter) with RYY in reverse and make a matching triangle together. RYY has the most factors. The last 3 end in 29, suggesting an end to the pattern as there is no 29th letter.\n- The final letter is B and it matches the middle letter, the two letters at the top and the two letters at the bottom if we do the BGY slide in one way.\n\n***[Only B](https://allmynoodles.com/torah-geometry/)***.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://allmynoodles.com/torah-geometry/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/4dbd4199-685a-4a1a-a0f1-c6d9343349d7\" alt=\"a-triangle-sandwich-3\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Speculating beyond the pyramidal model just described, the ratios seem to suggest that this geometry can be conceived sinusoidally as a Fourier series forming continuous triangular waves that reverse polarity in quarter cycles.

occur if the neutrino and antineutrino are the same particle (i.e. Majorana neutrinos) so the same neutrino can be emitted and absorbed within the nucleus.\n- In conventional double beta decay, two antineutrinos — one arising from each W vertex — are emitted from the nucleus, in addition to the two electrons. \n\nThe detection of neutrinoless double beta decay is thus a sensitive test of whether neutrinos are Majorana particles.  _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay#Neutrinoless_double_beta_decay))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a

but charged under a dark sector symmetry group.\n- Sterile neutrinos, which are singlets under both groups, mediate the interactions between the dark sector\nand the SM particles, and generate masses for the active neutrinos via the seesaw\nmechanism.\n- We explore the parameter space region where the observed Dark Matter relic abundance is determined by the annihilation into sterile neutrinos, both for fermion and scalar Dark Matter particles. The scalar Dark Matter case provides an interesting alternative to the usual Higgs portal scenario.\n\nWe also study the constraints from direct Dark Matter searches and the prospects for indirect detection\nvia sterile neutrino decays to leptons, which may be able to rule out Dark Matter masses below and around 100 GeV. _([Sterile Neutrino portal to Dark Matter II - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13822870/1607.02373.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13822870/1607.02373.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/eff99204-e52a-4628-b3e1-07812a8df44f\" alt=\"Sterile Neutrino portal to Dark Matter II\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The current status of the nucleon decay experiments is as follows: the partial lifetime\nlimit on p → π0e+ is τ (p → π0e+) &gt; 1.67 × 1034 years, and the bound on the partial lifetime for p → K+ν is τ (p → K+ν) &gt; 6.6 × 1033 years [42, 43].

String theories are quantum theories of gravity in the sense that they reduce to classical general relativity plus field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, contain a graviton, and are thought to be mathematically consistent. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.thingswedontknow.com/2016/08/search-for-the-graviton.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/378af784-1929-4e9a-9dc0-17e8a29f9325\" alt=\"Search for The Graviton\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There are 5 different string theories, <strong><em>each requiring 10 dimensions</em></strong>. On the other hand, string theory is supposed to be fundamental theory.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-warning\">Introduced earlier in GUTS: The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and, thus, must contain quantum gravity.\n- The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles, including the graviton that carries the gravitational force, act like one-dimensional vibrating strings.\n- Since gravity affects the time and space in which all else exists, Superstring theory is an attempt at a Theory of Everything (TOE).\n- Each independent quantum number is thought of as a separate dimension in some super space (analogous to the fact that the familiar dimensions of space are independent of one another) and is represented by a different type of Superstring.\n- As the universe evolved after the Big Bang and forces became distinct (spontaneous symmetry breaking), some of the dimensions of superspace are imagined to have curled up and become unnoticed.\n- Forces are expected to be unified only at extremely high energies and at particle separations on the order of 10^-35m. This could mean that Superstrings must have dimensions or wavelengths of this size or smaller.\n- Just as quantum gravity may imply that there are no time intervals shorter than some finite value, it also implies that there may be no sizes smaller than some tiny but finite value. That may be about 10^-35m.\n- If so, and if Superstring theory can explain all it strives to, then the structures of Superstrings are at the lower limit of the smallest possible size and can have no further substructure.\n- This would be the ultimate answer to the question the ancient Greeks considered: There is a finite lower limit to space. Not only is Superstring theory in its infancy, it deals with dimensions about 17 orders of 10^-18m magnitude smaller than the details that we have been able to observe directly.\n- It is thus relatively unconstrained by experiment, and there are a host of theoretical possibilities to choose from. This has led theorists to make choices subjectively (as always) on what is the most elegant theory, with less hope than usual that experiment will guide them.\n- It has also led to ***speculation of alternate universes***, with their Big Bangs creating each new universe with a random set of rules. These speculations may not be tested even in principle, since an alternate universe is by definition unattainable. It is something like exploring a self-consistent field of mathematics, with its axioms and rules of logic that are not consistent with nature.\n\nSuch endeavors have often given insight to mathematicians and scientists alike and occasionally have been directly related to the description of new discoveries. _([College Physics 2e - pdf page 1518](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/College_Physics_2e-WEB_7Zesafu.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://byjus.com/physics/stringtheory/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/feed/assets/8466209/6b9b301e-9076-4698-a641-83e29c1a5aa1\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">With William Thomson’s idea of _[vortex atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom)_ coming of age in the shape of string and superstring theories, in recent years hopes for a $nite theory of quantum gravity have centered on the quantum superstring (QSS).\n- Although the perturbation expansion yields finite terms, the summations do involve infinities [ 2481. However, that would still be true in quantum electrodynamics (QED) ; in perturbative treatments in quantum field theory these infinities are assumed to arise because of non-perturbative solutions and are regarded as an indication of the latter’s existence. Should we then consider the search for a theory of quantum gravity as having reached its goal and should we therefore cross it out as a motivation for the study of non-Riemannian gravitational theories?\n- The basic assumption in the post- 1984 treatment of the quantum superstring [ 2381 “theory of everything” \n(TOE), an on-mass-shell S-matrix type theory, is that its truncation below Planck mass should go over smoothly into an off-mass-shell relativistic quantum (point) local field theory * (including a version of ten-dimensional supergravity, in one sector of the “heterotic string” [ 2471, for instance) thus, even if the search were over, the same geometrical-gravitational question then relates to that truncated “low-energy” field theory and its gravitational sector. \n\nMoreover, it has been pointed out [ 1051 that consistency would then require the low-energy $eid theory to be fmite by itseIf! This then implies the existence of a finite or renormalizable relativistic quantum field theory of gravity. _([Gauge theory of gravity - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13804799/1-s2.0-037015739400111F-main_compressed.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13804640/1909.01791.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/bdd0ed5e-1e19-4647-9075-f7a0dc5024fd\" alt=\"476931_1_En_1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13815312/Gbook.pdf\">symmetry</a>\n of this <em>supergravity theory</em> is given by the supergroup OSp(1\\32) which gives the subgroups O(1) for the bosonic and Sp(32) for the fermion.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In general relativity, gravity is a force that bends and warps space-time around supermassive bodies.\n- Even though gravity is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, it is very weak compared to the other three forces (electromagnetism, weak force and strong force). So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.\n- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).\n- As far as [quantum mechanics](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13787269/aqm.pdf)\n is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.\n- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.\n\nIn the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles. Instead of point particles, strings were introduced. Even if strings collide, there will be no infinite energy problem.

In order to make this possible, supersymmetry has to become local, with a spacetime-dependent spinor ǫ(x) parametrising the infinitesimal SUSY transformation.\n- The key ingredient of supergravity is the graviton hµν , a massless spin-2 elementary particle which couples to the stress-energy tensor, thus mediating gravitational interactions.\n- Its fermionic, spin-3/2 partner, the gravitino ψαµ, equipped both with a spinor index α and a spacetime index µ, is the gauge field of local supersymmetry and becomes massive when SUSY is broken, by absorbing the emerging goldstino in the so-called super-Higgs mechanism.\n- There are two ways in which the graviton can be related to the metric gµν, either through an infinitesimal expansion gµν = ηµν + hµν around the flat metric ηµν , or through the vielbein formalism.\n\nAs is well-known from General Relativity, the metric (and implicitly the graviton) has tosatisfy the Einstein’s field equations _([Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/36035b02-6ac5-492d-81b2-5b290c892703\" alt=\"NLFIW\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Think of it this way, all gravitating bodies in the universe would be surrounded at all times by a cloud of tunneling electrons. We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.\n- These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.\n- The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.\n- Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.\n- This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.\n- As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.\n\nThe other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/22d4a42b-da13-4a78-a3d1-e15ee5c611c6\" alt=\"Cut the Standard Model\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">There are two groups of scientists (called collaborations) looking for evidence of gravitons in proton-proton collision experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Once a graviton has been created, it’s expected to decay in one of a few possible ways - and it’s evidence of these decays that the collaborations are looking for. ***ATLAS search for evidence that the gravitons decays into two photons, and the CMS search for evidence that the graviton decays into two jets (bursts) of hadrons (a particular class of particle)***.

The colors help this stand out. Let’s start with the top of the Y-Axis. ***All digits at the top of the Y-Axis reduce down to 1,7,4 or 5,2,8***.\n- This is important. Using this Prime Number Folio Coordinate System, it’s easier to think of prime numbers in separate sequences across from each other and right or left-handed rather than next to each other on a number line. I see them as Chiral.\n- All digits in on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis reduce down to 5, 2 or 8. (For example 179 has 3 digits, what matters is that the numbers 1 +7+9 sum to the number 8.) So this would be considered a right-handed prime number. Or a number on the right side of the Y-Axis.\n\nThe image stands on its own. The patterns should jump off the page. Especially with the color. Right-handed numbers have different properties than the left-handed numbers. These observations are in no way mathematically rigorous.\n- The numbers on the right side `(5,2,8)|` of the Y-Axis include not only prime numbers, but the products of the prime numbers combined from both sides of the Y-axis.\n- Every product on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis is created from two primes (or semi-primes or combination of semi-primes) from both sides of the Y-axis (one from each side), which ALWAYS sum to an exact multiple of 6. These are plotted on the right side of the X-Axis. (For example `7×11=77`. While `7+11=18`.)\n\nUsing this Folio Coordinate System, it’s easy to see how the products and sums and their distribution are directly related to each other. You might want to start thinking about the Goldbach Conjecture.\n- All products and sums on the right side are indigo/purple to show how they combine with the red and blue prime numbers.\n- It looks like we are simply adding 6 to each Axis/number line, when in fact we are adding the number 1 to each consecutive number but positioning it at different points while moving around both the X and Y Axis.\n- The colors should help your eye follow the numbers. Follow the colors of the rainbow/number combination to help you move around the system. `(R-1,O-2,Y-3,G-4,B-5,I-6)`.\n\n***The number 35 is an important number***. It’s the first number on the right-hand side that’s a product of two prime factors of `5 x 7 = 35`.\n- The sum of `5 + 7 = 12`. Since the right-handed numbers are distributed evenly by 6, we can add `7 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on the number 77.\n- So now we know that starting with the number 35 if we add 42 continuously we will ***NEVER land on a prime number***. We can also add `5 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on 65.\n- We also know that `7 + 11 = 18`. The next number that introduces a product of two primes is `5 x 13 = 65` and `5 + 13 = 18`. So we can take `6 x 13 = 78` and add this to 65 and land on 143. Which is the product of `11 x 13 = 143`.\n- Starting with 65 we can add 78 continuously and ***NEVER land on a prime number***.\n- In the meantime 77 (The product of 7 and 11 now introduces the prime number 11 into the mix. So `77 + (6x11) = 143`.\n- ***Starting with 77 we can add 66 continuously and NEVER land on a prime number***. \n\nYou can’t add multiples of 6 until that multiple is introduced into the sequence. The primes on the left behave differently.

On the other hand, string theory is supposed to be fundamental theory.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-warning\">Introduced earlier in GUTS: The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and, thus, must contain quantum gravity.\n- The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles, including the graviton that carries the gravitational force, act like one-dimensional vibrating strings.\n- Since gravity affects the time and space in which all else exists, Superstring theory is an attempt at a Theory of Everything (TOE).\n- Each independent quantum number is thought of as a separate dimension in some super space (analogous to the fact that the familiar dimensions of space are independent of one another) and is represented by a different type of Superstring.\n- As the universe evolved after the Big Bang and forces became distinct (spontaneous symmetry breaking), some of the dimensions of superspace are imagined to have curled up and become unnoticed.\n- Forces are expected to be unified only at extremely high energies and at particle separations on the order of 10^-35m. This could mean that Superstrings must have dimensions or wavelengths of this size or smaller.\n- Just as quantum gravity may imply that there are no time intervals shorter than some finite value, it also implies that there may be no sizes smaller than some tiny but finite value. That may be about 10^-35m.\n- If so, and if Superstring theory can explain all it strives to, then the structures of Superstrings are at the lower limit of the smallest possible size and can have no further substructure.\n- This would be the ultimate answer to the question the ancient Greeks considered: There is a finite lower limit to space. Not only is Superstring theory in its infancy, it deals with dimensions about 17 orders of 10^-18m magnitude smaller than the details that we have been able to observe directly.\n- It is thus relatively unconstrained by experiment, and there are a host of theoretical possibilities to choose from. This has led theorists to make choices subjectively (as always) on what is the most elegant theory, with less hope than usual that experiment will guide them.\n- It has also led to ***speculation of alternate universes***, with their Big Bangs creating each new universe with a random set of rules. These speculations may not be tested even in principle, since an alternate universe is by definition unattainable. It is something like exploring a self-consistent field of mathematics, with its axioms and rules of logic that are not consistent with nature.\n\nSuch endeavors have often given insight to mathematicians and scientists alike and occasionally have been directly related to the description of new discoveries. _([College Physics 2e - pdf page 1518](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/College_Physics_2e-WEB_7Zesafu.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://byjus.com/physics/stringtheory/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/feed/assets/8466209/6b9b301e-9076-4698-a641-83e29c1a5aa1\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">With William Thomson’s idea of _[vortex atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom)_ coming of age in the shape of string and superstring theories, in recent years hopes for a $nite theory of quantum gravity have centered on the quantum superstring (QSS).\n- Although the perturbation expansion yields finite terms, the summations do involve infinities [ 2481. However, that would still be true in quantum electrodynamics (QED) ; in perturbative treatments in quantum field theory these infinities are assumed to arise because of non-perturbative solutions and are regarded as an indication of the latter’s existence. Should we then consider the search for a theory of quantum gravity as having reached its goal and should we therefore cross it out as a motivation for the study of non-Riemannian gravitational theories?\n- The basic assumption in the post- 1984 treatment of the quantum superstring [ 2381 “theory of everything” \n(TOE), an on-mass-shell S-matrix type theory, is that its truncation below Planck mass should go over smoothly into an off-mass-shell relativistic quantum (point) local field theory * (including a version of ten-dimensional supergravity, in one sector of the “heterotic string” [ 2471, for instance) thus, even if the search were over, the same geometrical-gravitational question then relates to that truncated “low-energy” field theory and its gravitational sector. \n\nMoreover, it has been pointed out [ 1051 that consistency would then require the low-energy $eid theory to be fmite by itseIf!

So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.\n- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).\n- As far as [quantum mechanics](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13787269/aqm.pdf)\n is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.\n- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.\n\nIn the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles.

In order to make this possible, supersymmetry has to become local, with a spacetime-dependent spinor ǫ(x) parametrising the infinitesimal SUSY transformation.\n- The key ingredient of supergravity is the graviton hµν , a massless spin-2 elementary particle which couples to the stress-energy tensor, thus mediating gravitational interactions.\n- Its fermionic, spin-3/2 partner, the gravitino ψαµ, equipped both with a spinor index α and a spacetime index µ, is the gauge field of local supersymmetry and becomes massive when SUSY is broken, by absorbing the emerging goldstino in the so-called super-Higgs mechanism.\n- There are two ways in which the graviton can be related to the metric gµν, either through an infinitesimal expansion gµν = ηµν + hµν around the flat metric ηµν , or through the vielbein formalism.\n\nAs is well-known from General Relativity, the metric (and implicitly the graviton) has tosatisfy the Einstein’s field equations _([Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/36035b02-6ac5-492d-81b2-5b290c892703\" alt=\"NLFIW\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Think of it this way, all gravitating bodies in the universe would be surrounded at all times by a cloud of tunneling electrons. We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.\n- These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.\n- The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.\n- Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.\n- This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.\n- As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.\n\nThe other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/22d4a42b-da13-4a78-a3d1-e15ee5c611c6\" alt=\"Cut the Standard Model\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">There are two groups of scientists (called collaborations) looking for evidence of gravitons in proton-proton collision experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

The colors help this stand out. Let’s start with the top of the Y-Axis. ***All digits at the top of the Y-Axis reduce down to 1,7,4 or 5,2,8***.\n- This is important. Using this Prime Number Folio Coordinate System, it’s easier to think of prime numbers in separate sequences across from each other and right or left-handed rather than next to each other on a number line. I see them as Chiral.\n- All digits in on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis reduce down to 5, 2 or 8. (For example 179 has 3 digits, what matters is that the numbers 1 +7+9 sum to the number 8.) So this would be considered a right-handed prime number. Or a number on the right side of the Y-Axis.\n\nThe image stands on its own. The patterns should jump off the page. Especially with the color. Right-handed numbers have different properties than the left-handed numbers. These observations are in no way mathematically rigorous.\n- The numbers on the right side `(5,2,8)|` of the Y-Axis include not only prime numbers, but the products of the prime numbers combined from both sides of the Y-axis.\n- Every product on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis is created from two primes (or semi-primes or combination of semi-primes) from both sides of the Y-axis (one from each side), which ALWAYS sum to an exact multiple of 6. These are plotted on the right side of the X-Axis. (For example `7×11=77`. While `7+11=18`.)\n\nUsing this Folio Coordinate System, it’s easy to see how the products and sums and their distribution are directly related to each other. You might want to start thinking about the Goldbach Conjecture.\n- All products and sums on the right side are indigo/purple to show how they combine with the red and blue prime numbers.\n- It looks like we are simply adding 6 to each Axis/number line, when in fact we are adding the number 1 to each consecutive number but positioning it at different points while moving around both the X and Y Axis.\n- The colors should help your eye follow the numbers. Follow the colors of the rainbow/number combination to help you move around the system. `(R-1,O-2,Y-3,G-4,B-5,I-6)`.\n\n***The number 35 is an important number***. It’s the first number on the right-hand side that’s a product of two prime factors of `5 x 7 = 35`.\n- The sum of `5 + 7 = 12`. Since the right-handed numbers are distributed evenly by 6, we can add `7 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on the number 77.\n- So now we know that starting with the number 35 if we add 42 continuously we will ***NEVER land on a prime number***. We can also add `5 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on 65.\n- We also know that `7 + 11 = 18`. The next number that introduces a product of two primes is `5 x 13 = 65` and `5 + 13 = 18`. So we can take `6 x 13 = 78` and add this to 65 and land on 143. Which is the product of `11 x 13 = 143`.\n- Starting with 65 we can add 78 continuously and ***NEVER land on a prime number***.\n- In the meantime 77 (The product of 7 and 11 now introduces the prime number 11 into the mix. So `77 + (6x11) = 143`.\n- ***Starting with 77 we can add 66 continuously and NEVER land on a prime number***. \n\nYou can’t add multiples of 6 until that multiple is introduced into the sequence. The primes on the left behave differently. You can still move around using multiples of 6, but there is no common starting point like the number 35.\n- You have to start with the squares of ***5 at 25 (in blue)*** for one sequence of numbers and the square of ***7 at 49 (in red)*** for the other sequence of numbers.\n- The sums of these products are also not exact multiples of 6. They sum to 10 and 14 and are matched to the split X Axis on the left-hand side of the graph.\n\nThe Prime Number Folio Coordinate System and it’s natural numbers are all you need to find a prime number or a composite number and it’s factors. ***No need for complex numbers or the Reimann Hypothesis***. _([Medium](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/prime-number-folio-coordinate-system-78b316b65cf7))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>Being brought forth you will also begin to uncover <em><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13789887/4355025.pdf\">the irrelevant role</a></em> that the Riemann hypothesis plays <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/10.html#symmetry-breaking\">7 ate 9</a></em> in understanding this elegant distribution.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SE6UamC9ew0fIraKHstytwjQMY4LmVe8/view\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/285091346-8eb3dfda-4b06-4186-bf5d-a3050db5fe1b.png\" alt=\"The Prime Number Folio Coordinate System \" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This curve is a [polar plot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg) of _[the first 20](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#file-2_assigning-md)_ non-trivial [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function) zeros including Gram points along the critical line _[ζ(1/2+t)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#file-fork-md)_ for real values of t running from 0 to 50.

Equivalently, they are the linear transformations fixing that hyperboloid of two sheets. If we discard one of the sheets, we obtain the orthochronous (time-preserving) subgroup.\n- From the perspective of the centre of the cone, the hyperboloid looks like an open disc. The orthochronous Lorentz transformations precisely correspond to distance-preserving transformations of the hyperbolic plane. These are themselves determined uniquely by a conformal (or anticonformal) transformation of the ‘circle at infinity’.\n- Adding an extra dimension, the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(3,1) is isomorphic to the group of distance-preserving transformations of hyperbolic 3-space, which is again isomorphic to the group of (anti-)conformal transformations of the ‘sphere at infinity’, namely our index-2 supergroup of the Möbius group.\n\nMoreover, this nicely generalises: the group generated by geometric inversions on the n-sphere is abstractly isomorphic to the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(n+1,1). ***And when n = 24, we get a very beautiful discrete subgroup, namely the automorphism group of the II(25,1)*** lattice intimately related to the [Leech lattice](http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/leech-lattice/). _([Complex Projective 4-Space](https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2013/10/10/what-should-this-group-be-called/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ff442f14-c1c4-4e87-a3e5-8bc157d20e46\" alt=\"spacetime\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bispinor-structure\">Bispinor Structure</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The Lie group structure of the Lorentz group is explored.

They also have anti-colors: anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue. Like the electromagnetic force's positive and negative charges, different colors attract, and the same colors repel. Some particles that have color charge are quarks and antiquarks.\n- The type of quark is not related to that quark's color charge at all. Quarks are one of the smallest particles currently known. They take up no space because they are points, and they are the only particles that we have not been able to break apart from other particles yet. This is because the nature of the strong force between particles is that it becomes stronger the further away the particles are.\n\nThe force carrier of the strong force is called the gluon. Gluons also have color charge. Both quarks and gluons have properties that make them unique from other particles, as described in the Standard Model. _([Wikipedia](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction))_.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/df0fb45e-8610-48d6-b9ff-dc0f19ba22c9\" alt=\"Nuclear_Force_anim\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Shortly after the existence of quarks was proposed by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) and [George Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zweig) in 1964, [Moo-Young Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo-Young_Han) and [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu) introduced a hidden internal degree of freedom in which quark wave functions were antisymmetric, thus solving the spin-statistics problem of the Gell Mann-Zweig quark model.\n- Han and Nambu initially designated this degree of freedom by the group SU(3)', but it was referred to in later papers as \"the three triplet model.\" One feature of the model (which was originally preferred by Han and Nambu) was that it permitted integrally charged quarks, as well as the fractionally charged quarks initially proposed by Zweig and Gell-Mann.\n- Somewhat later, in the early 1970s, Gell-Mann, in several conference talks, coined the name \"Color\" to describe the internal degree of freedom of the three triplet model, and advocated a new field theory, designated as \"Quantum Chromodynamics\" (QCD) to describe the interaction of quarks and gluons within hadrons. In Gell-Mann's QCD, each quark and gluon had fractional electric charge, and carried what came to be called \"Color Charge\" in the space of the Color degree of freedom.\nIn quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a quark's color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight gluon colors for an explanation.\n- All three colors mixed together, or any one of these colors and its complement (or negative), is \"colorless\" or \"white\" and has a net color charge of zero. Due to a property of the strong interaction called color confinement, free particles must have a color charge of zero.\n- A baryon is composed of three quarks, which must be one each of red, green, and blue colors; likewise an antibaryon is composed of three antiquarks, one each of antired, antigreen and antiblue. A meson is made from one quark and one antiquark; the quark can be any color, and the antiquark has the matching anticolor.\n\nThe following illustrates the coupling constants for color-charged particles. In a quantum field theory, a coupling constant and a charge are different but related notions. The coupling constant sets the magnitude of the force of interaction; for example, in quantum electrodynamics, the fine-structure constant is a coupling constant. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/9d318dfa-ef33-4653-bcc2-6a4f548e2d1d\" alt=\"Neutron_QCD_Animation\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/efe55c6d-926c-47bb-80db-7d892eb3f103\" alt=\"IMG_20240111_062522\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b1d3bccd-a423-4ebb-a397-e973b2cc8e6e\" alt=\"SO(10)\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>This diagram is representing groupings (leptons, quarks, weak-force bosons) with 6 quarks in a way that par\nallels the 6 leptons.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor). Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).[![ang5](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/f6dc49c5-261f-4a8d-8270-cd2f2c25a03d)\n](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/schomeru/lecturenotes/Quantum%20Mechanics/S16.html)\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor). The convention used here is that the article on the Dirac spinor presents [plane-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane-wave) solutions to the Dirac equation using the Dirac convention for the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices). That is, the Dirac spinor is a bispinor in the Dirac convention.\n- Bispinors are elements of a 4-dimensional complex vector space (1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) representation of the Lorentz group.\n\nDirac bispinor 6D shows ***eight (8) quantum spin eigenstates in six (6) dimensions*** of complex spacetime: 0 (the Higgs field), ±½ (fermions), ±1 (bosons), ±⅔ (anti-fermions), 2 (graviton).

Equivalently, they are the linear transformations fixing that hyperboloid of two sheets. If we discard one of the sheets, we obtain the orthochronous (time-preserving) subgroup.\n- From the perspective of the centre of the cone, the hyperboloid looks like an open disc. The orthochronous Lorentz transformations precisely correspond to distance-preserving transformations of the hyperbolic plane. These are themselves determined uniquely by a conformal (or anticonformal) transformation of the ‘circle at infinity’.\n- Adding an extra dimension, the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(3,1) is isomorphic to the group of distance-preserving transformations of hyperbolic 3-space, which is again isomorphic to the group of (anti-)conformal transformations of the ‘sphere at infinity’, namely our index-2 supergroup of the Möbius group.\n\nMoreover, this nicely generalises: the group generated by geometric inversions on the n-sphere is abstractly isomorphic to the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(n+1,1). ***And when n = 24, we get a very beautiful discrete subgroup, namely the automorphism group of the II(25,1)*** lattice intimately related to the [Leech lattice](http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/leech-lattice/). _([Complex Projective 4-Space](https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2013/10/10/what-should-this-group-be-called/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ff442f14-c1c4-4e87-a3e5-8bc157d20e46\" alt=\"spacetime\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bispinor-structure\">Bispinor Structure</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The Lie group structure of the Lorentz group is explored.

They also have anti-colors: anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue. Like the electromagnetic force's positive and negative charges, different colors attract, and the same colors repel. Some particles that have color charge are quarks and antiquarks.\n- The type of quark is not related to that quark's color charge at all. Quarks are one of the smallest particles currently known. They take up no space because they are points, and they are the only particles that we have not been able to break apart from other particles yet. This is because the nature of the strong force between particles is that it becomes stronger the further away the particles are.\n\nThe force carrier of the strong force is called the gluon. Gluons also have color charge. Both quarks and gluons have properties that make them unique from other particles, as described in the Standard Model. _([Wikipedia](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction))_.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/df0fb45e-8610-48d6-b9ff-dc0f19ba22c9\" alt=\"Nuclear_Force_anim\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Shortly after the existence of quarks was proposed by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) and [George Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zweig) in 1964, [Moo-Young Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo-Young_Han) and [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu) introduced a hidden internal degree of freedom in which quark wave functions were antisymmetric, thus solving the spin-statistics problem of the Gell Mann-Zweig quark model.\n- Han and Nambu initially designated this degree of freedom by the group SU(3)', but it was referred to in later papers as \"the three triplet model.\" One feature of the model (which was originally preferred by Han and Nambu) was that it permitted integrally charged quarks, as well as the fractionally charged quarks initially proposed by Zweig and Gell-Mann.\n- Somewhat later, in the early 1970s, Gell-Mann, in several conference talks, coined the name \"Color\" to describe the internal degree of freedom of the three triplet model, and advocated a new field theory, designated as \"Quantum Chromodynamics\" (QCD) to describe the interaction of quarks and gluons within hadrons. In Gell-Mann's QCD, each quark and gluon had fractional electric charge, and carried what came to be called \"Color Charge\" in the space of the Color degree of freedom.\nIn quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a quark's color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight gluon colors for an explanation.\n- All three colors mixed together, or any one of these colors and its complement (or negative), is \"colorless\" or \"white\" and has a net color charge of zero. Due to a property of the strong interaction called color confinement, free particles must have a color charge of zero.\n- A baryon is composed of three quarks, which must be one each of red, green, and blue colors; likewise an antibaryon is composed of three antiquarks, one each of antired, antigreen and antiblue. A meson is made from one quark and one antiquark; the quark can be any color, and the antiquark has the matching anticolor.\n\nThe following illustrates the coupling constants for color-charged particles. In a quantum field theory, a coupling constant and a charge are different but related notions. The coupling constant sets the magnitude of the force of interaction; for example, in quantum electrodynamics, the fine-structure constant is a coupling constant. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/9d318dfa-ef33-4653-bcc2-6a4f548e2d1d\" alt=\"Neutron_QCD_Animation\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/efe55c6d-926c-47bb-80db-7d892eb3f103\" alt=\"IMG_20240111_062522\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b1d3bccd-a423-4ebb-a397-e973b2cc8e6e\" alt=\"SO(10)\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>This diagram is representing groupings (leptons, quarks, weak-force bosons) with 6 quarks in a way that par\nallels the 6 leptons.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor). Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).[![ang5](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/f6dc49c5-261f-4a8d-8270-cd2f2c25a03d)\n](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/schomeru/lecturenotes/Quantum%20Mechanics/S16.html)\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor).

Successive terms in the series at higher powers of usually become smaller. An approximate 'perturbation solution' is obtained by truncating the series, usually by keeping only the first two terms, the solution to the known problem and the 'first order' perturbation correction.\n\nPerturbation theory is used in a wide range of fields, and reaches its most sophisticated and advanced forms in [quantum field theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory). [Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)) describes the use of this method in [quantum mechanics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).

Successive terms in the series at higher powers of usually become smaller. An approximate 'perturbation solution' is obtained by truncating the series, usually by keeping only the first two terms, the solution to the known problem and the 'first order' perturbation correction.\n\nPerturbation theory is used in a wide range of fields, and reaches its most sophisticated and advanced forms in [quantum field theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory).

[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor).\n- Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor). The convention used here is that the article on the Dirac spinor presents [plane-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane-wave) solutions to the Dirac equation using the Dirac convention for the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices). That is, the Dirac spinor is a bispinor in the Dirac convention.\n\nBy contrast, the article below concentrates primarily on the Weyl, or chiral representation, is less focused on the Dirac equation, and more focused on the geometric structure, including the geometry of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group). Thus, much of what is said below can be applied to the [Majorana equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_equation). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/d36af237-9c23-4975-b04f-987bcb6a108b\" alt=\"The-electric-dipole-bispinor-as-source-of-fields-of-Matter-and-Antimatter\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"matter-vs-antimatter\">Matter vs Antimatter</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Giving a specific example of a result obtained with data from the ATLAS experiment, Priscilla Pani, ATLAS experiment co-convener of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, highlights how the collaboration has recently searched the full LHC dataset from the machine’s second run (Run 2), collected between 2015 and 2018, ***to [look for instances in which the Higgs boson might decay into dark-matter particles](https://atlas.cern/updates/physics-briefing/probing-dark-matter-higgs-boson). “We found no instances of this decay but we were able to set the strongest limits to date on the likelihood that it occurs,”**\" says Pani. _([CERN](https://home.cern/news/series/lhc-physics-ten/breaking-new-ground-search-dark-matter))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://home.cern/news/series/lhc-physics-ten/breaking-new-ground-search-dark-matter\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/247aea1d-3933-4b04-8a12-dce8377d7066\" alt=\"Map-1_Plan de travail 1\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In order to be ***[four-spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor#Four-spinor_for_particles)*** like the electron and other [lepton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton) components, there must be one quark component for every combination of [flavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_(particle_physics)) and [colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge), ***bringing the total to 24 (3 for charged leptons, 3 for neutrinos, and 2·3·3 = 18 for quarks).

The above \n considerations show that the interaction of heavy particles with this field is much larger than that of light particles with it.\n- Now the binding energy of the proton in C12, which is estimated from the difference of masses of C12 and B11, is. This corresponds to a binding energy 0,0152 in mass unit, being ***thirty (30) times the electron mass***. _(page 53)_\n- Assuming λ=5×10-¹²cm, we.obtain for me a value ***2×10² times as large as the electron mass***. As such a quantum with large mass and positive or negative charge has never been found by the experiment, the above theory seems to be on a wrong line. We can show, however, that, in the ordinary nuclear transformation, such a quantum can not be emitted into outer space. _(page 54)_\n\nThe interaction of such a quantum with the heavy particle should be far greater than that with the light particle in order to account for the large interaction of the neutron and the proton as well as the small probability of β-disintegration. _([Yukawa - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13961751/Yukawa.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The Prime Recycling ζ(s):\n(2,3), (29,89), (36,68), (72,42), (100,50), (2,3), (29,89), ...**infinity**\n\n----------------------+-----+-----+-----+                                    ---\n     7 --------- 1,2:1|   1 |  30 |  40 | 71 (2,3) ‹-------------@----        |\n     |                +-----+-----+-----+-----+                        |      |\n     |  8 ‹------  3:2|   1 |  30 |  40 |  90 | 161 (7) ‹---           |      5¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+-----+             |          |      |\n     |  |  6 ‹-- 4,6:3|   1 |  30 | 200 | 231 (10,11,12) ‹--|--- ✔️    |      |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+             |   |      |     ---\n      --|--|-----» 7:4|   1 |  30 |  40 | 200 | 271 (13) --›    | {5®} |      |\n        |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+                 |      |      |\n         --|---› 8,9:5|   1 |  30 | 200 | 231 (14,15) ---------› ✔️    |      7¨\n289        |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |      |\n |          ----› 10:6|  20 |   5 |  10 |  70 |  90 | 195 (19) --› Φ   | {6®} |\n  --------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |     ---\n     67 --------› 11:7|   5 |   9 |  14 (20) --------› ¤               |      |\n     |                +-----+-----+-----+                              |      |\n     |  78 ‹----- 12:8|   9 |  60 |  40 | 109 (26) «------------       |     11¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+                       |      |      |\n     |  |  86‹--- 13:9|   9 |  60 |  69 (27) «-- 2×Δ9 (2×MEC30) | {2®} |      |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+                       |      |     ---\n     |  |   ---› 14:10|   9 |  60 |  40 | 109 (28) -------------       |      |\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+                              |      |\n     |   ---› 15,18:11|   1 |  30 |  40 | 71 (29,30,31,32) ----------        13¨\n329  |                +-----+-----+-----+                                     |\n  |   ‹--------- 19:12|  10 |  60 | {70} (36) ‹--------------------- Φ        |\n   -------------------+-----+-----+                                          ---\n    786 ‹------- 20:13|  90 |  90 (38) ‹-------------- ¤                      |\n     |                +-----+-----+                                           |\n     | 618 ‹- 21,22:14|   8 |  40 |  48 (40,41) ‹----------------------      17¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |      |\n     |  | 594 ‹- 23:15|   8 |  40 |  70 |  60 | 100 | 278 (42) «--     |{6'®} |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+             |    |     ---\n      --|--|-»24,27:16|   8 |  40 |  48 (43,44,45,46) ------------|----       |\n        |  |          +-----+-----+                               |           |\n         --|---› 28:17| 100 | {100} (50) ------------------------»           19¨\n168        |          +-----+                                                 |\n|         102 -› 29:18| 50  | 50(68) --&gt;

The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of [particle decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay): the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state.\n- Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), whereas muons and taus can only be produced in [high energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_energy_physics) collisions (such as those involving [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) and those carried out in [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator)).\n- Leptons have various [intrinsic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_properties), including [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge), [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)), [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass).\n- Unlike [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), however, leptons are not subject to the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction), but they are subject to the other three [fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction): [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation), the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction), and to ***[electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism)***, of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.\n\n[![Electrodynamics](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b8629985-8996-4819-9e19-a106b98eed48)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#beyond-the-96)\n\nFor every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of [antiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle), known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have [equal magnitude but opposite sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conjugation).

This seemingly innocuous difference marks an important change in the conceptual basis of quantum physics.\n- Its historical, theoretical, and conceptual roots are here reconstructed. The link between Weinberg's proof and Pauli's original is highlighted: Weinberg's proof turns out to do justice to Pauli's anti-Dirac lines of thought.\n\nThe work of Furry and Oppenheimer is also surveyed as a “third way” between the textbook tradition established by _[Pauli and Weinberg's approach - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13774357/1-s2.0-S1355219803000662-main.pdf)_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1355219803000662\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/78c62ab2-c94b-4b4b-a76b-6fe3ffeb1c06\" alt=\"Increasing_disorder svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This is nothing but <strong><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle\">Pauli’s Exclusion Principle</a></em></strong> forbidding the possibility of any two indistinguishable particles being in the same dynamic state (Pauli, 1925).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"irrational-partitions\">Irrational Partitions</h2>\n\n<p>By this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density.

1960s [Peter Swinnerton-Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Swinnerton-Dyer) used the [EDSAC computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC) to calculate the number of points modulo p (denoted by Np) for a large number of primes p on elliptic curves whose rank was known.\n- Based on these numerical results, [Birch &amp; Swinnerton-Dyer

[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor).\n- Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor). The convention used here is that the article on the Dirac spinor presents [plane-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane-wave) solutions to the Dirac equation using the Dirac convention for the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices). That is, the Dirac spinor is a bispinor in the Dirac convention.\n\nBy contrast, the article below concentrates primarily on the Weyl, or chiral representation, is less focused on the Dirac equation, and more focused on the geometric structure, including the geometry of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group). Thus, much of what is said below can be applied to the [Majorana equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_equation). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/d36af237-9c23-4975-b04f-987bcb6a108b\" alt=\"The-electric-dipole-bispinor-as-source-of-fields-of-Matter-and-Antimatter\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"matter-vs-antimatter\">Matter vs Antimatter</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Giving a specific example of a result obtained with data from the ATLAS experiment, Priscilla Pani, ATLAS experiment co-convener of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, highlights how the collaboration has recently searched the full LHC dataset from the machine’s second run (Run 2), collected between 2015 and 2018, ***to [look for instances in which the Higgs boson might decay into dark-matter particles](https://atlas.cern/updates/physics-briefing/probing-dark-matter-higgs-boson). “We found no instances of this decay but we were able to set the strongest limits to date on the likelihood that it occurs,”**\" says Pani. _([CERN](https://home.cern/news/series/lhc-physics-ten/breaking-new-ground-search-dark-matter))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://home.cern/news/series/lhc-physics-ten/breaking-new-ground-search-dark-matter\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/247aea1d-3933-4b04-8a12-dce8377d7066\" alt=\"Map-1_Plan de travail 1\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In order to be ***[four-spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor#Four-spinor_for_particles)*** like the electron and other [lepton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton) components, there must be one quark component for every combination of [flavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_(particle_physics)) and [colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge), ***bringing the total to 24 (3 for charged leptons, 3 for neutrinos, and 2·3·3 = 18 for quarks).

Therefore we use the primes ***43 and 71*** as corresponding _[eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues)_ which is the factor by which the eigenvector is [scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors#Overview).\n</code></pre>  \n<p><strong><em>19 x 6 = 43 + 71 = 114</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/224346485-13d27a0b-bfe3-43f0-94da-f75313dc9d77.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>f(30) = 66 - 30 - 30 - 5 = 1</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">p r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61 👈 1st spin\n3 2 0 1 0 2 👉 2\n4 3 1 1 0 3 👉 89 - 29 = 61 - 1 = 60\n5 5 2 1 0 5 👉 11 + 29 = 37 + 3 = 40 \n          6 👉 11s Composite Partition ◄--- 102 👈 4th spin\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23 👈 1 ◄--- break MEC30 symmetry ✔️\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19 ◄--- #43 ◄--- 24s 👈 30\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- #17 ◄--- #49 ◄--- 32s 👈 30\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👈 5 ◄--- antisymmetric state ✔️\n           18 👉 7s Composite Partition ◄--- 168 👈 7th spin\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36  👉 7s\n-----\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>These features are the solution to arrange 30 files located in in four (4) of zone folders as the lexer to cope with the <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/addition/#prime-hexagon\">Prime Spin</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/#eulers-identity\">MEC30 Structure</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Now such interaction between the elementary particles can be described by means of a field of force, just as the interaction between the charged particles is described by the electromagnetic field. The above \n considerations show that the interaction of heavy particles with this field is much larger than that of light particles with it.\n- Now the binding energy of the proton in C12, which is estimated from the difference of masses of C12 and B11, is. This corresponds to a binding energy 0,0152 in mass unit, being ***thirty (30) times the electron mass***. _(page 53)_\n- Assuming λ=5×10-¹²cm, we.obtain for me a value ***2×10² times as large as the electron mass***. As such a quantum with large mass and positive or negative charge has never been found by the experiment, the above theory seems to be on a wrong line. We can show, however, that, in the ordinary nuclear transformation, such a quantum can not be emitted into outer space. _(page 54)_\n\nThe interaction of such a quantum with the heavy particle should be far greater than that with the light particle in order to account for the large interaction of the neutron and the proton as well as the small probability of β-disintegration. _([Yukawa - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13961751/Yukawa.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The Prime Recycling ζ(s):\n(2,3), (29,89), (36,68), (72,42), (100,50), (2,3), (29,89), ...**infinity**\n\n----------------------+-----+-----+-----+                                    ---\n     7 --------- 1,2:1|   1 |  30 |  40 | 71 (2,3) ‹-------------@----        |\n     |                +-----+-----+-----+-----+                        |      |\n     |  8 ‹------  3:2|   1 |  30 |  40 |  90 | 161 (7) ‹---           |      5¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+-----+             |          |      |\n     |  |  6 ‹-- 4,6:3|   1 |  30 | 200 | 231 (10,11,12) ‹--|--- ✔️    |      |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+             |   |      |     ---\n      --|--|-----» 7:4|   1 |  30 |  40 | 200 | 271 (13) --›    | {5®} |      |\n        |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+                 |      |      |\n         --|---› 8,9:5|   1 |  30 | 200 | 231 (14,15) ---------› ✔️    |      7¨\n289        |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |      |\n |          ----› 10:6|  20 |   5 |  10 |  70 |  90 | 195 (19) --› Φ   | {6®} |\n  --------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |     ---\n     67 --------› 11:7|   5 |   9 |  14 (20) --------› ¤               |      |\n     |                +-----+-----+-----+                              |      |\n     |  78 ‹----- 12:8|   9 |  60 |  40 | 109 (26) «------------       |     11¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+                       |      |      |\n     |  |  86‹--- 13:9|   9 |  60 |  69 (27) «-- 2×Δ9 (2×MEC30) | {2®} |      |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+                       |      |     ---\n     |  |   ---› 14:10|   9 |  60 |  40 | 109 (28) -------------       |      |\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+                              |      |\n     |   ---› 15,18:11|   1 |  30 |  40 | 71 (29,30,31,32) ----------        13¨\n329  |                +-----+-----+-----+                                     |\n  |   ‹--------- 19:12|  10 |  60 | {70} (36) ‹--------------------- Φ        |\n   -------------------+-----+-----+                                          ---\n    786 ‹------- 20:13|  90 |  90 (38) ‹-------------- ¤                      |\n     |                +-----+-----+                                           |\n     | 618 ‹- 21,22:14|   8 |  40 |  48 (40,41) ‹----------------------      17¨\n     |  |             +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                  |      |\n     |  | 594 ‹- 23:15|   8 |  40 |  70 |  60 | 100 | 278 (42) «--     |{6'®} |\n     |  |  |          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+             |    |     ---\n      --|--|-»24,27:16|   8 |  40 |  48 (43,44,45,46) ------------|----       |\n        |  |          +-----+-----+                               |           |\n         --|---› 28:17| 100 | {100} (50) ------------------------»           19¨\n168        |          +-----+                                                 |\n|         102 -› 29:18| 50  | 50(68) --&gt;

The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of [particle decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay): the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state.\n- Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), whereas muons and taus can only be produced in [high energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_energy_physics) collisions (such as those involving [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) and those carried out in [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator)).\n- Leptons have various [intrinsic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_properties), including [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge), [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)), [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass).\n- Unlike [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), however, leptons are not subject to the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction), but they are subject to the other three [fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction): [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation), the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction), and to ***[electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism)***, of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.\n\n[![Electrodynamics](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b8629985-8996-4819-9e19-a106b98eed48)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#beyond-the-96)\n\nFor every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of [antiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle), known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have [equal magnitude but opposite sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conjugation).

This seemingly innocuous difference marks an important change in the conceptual basis of quantum physics.\n- Its historical, theoretical, and conceptual roots are here reconstructed. The link between Weinberg's proof and Pauli's original is highlighted: Weinberg's proof turns out to do justice to Pauli's anti-Dirac lines of thought.\n\nThe work of Furry and Oppenheimer is also surveyed as a “third way” between the textbook tradition established by _[Pauli and Weinberg's approach - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13774357/1-s2.0-S1355219803000662-main.pdf)_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1355219803000662\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/78c62ab2-c94b-4b4b-a76b-6fe3ffeb1c06\" alt=\"Increasing_disorder svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This is nothing but <strong><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle\">Pauli’s Exclusion Principle</a></em></strong> forbidding the possibility of any two indistinguishable particles being in the same dynamic state (Pauli, 1925).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"irrational-partitions\">Irrational Partitions</h2>\n\n<p>By this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density.

In the table above, gauge couplings are listed as free parameters, therefore with this choice the Weinberg angle is not a free parameter\n- The solution to both these problems comes from the Higgs mechanism, which involves scalar fields (the number of which depend on the exact form of Higgs mechanism) which (to give the briefest possible description) are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom, and which couple to the fermions via ***Yukawa coupling*** to create what looks like mass terms.\n\nThe next step is to ***couple the gauge fields to the fermions***, allowing for interactions. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6f/e3/f0/b8f7292f1f2749/DE102011101032A9.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png\" alt=\"Euler's identity\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner\">The GitHub Runner</a> you can <a href=\"https://github.com/tcardonne/docker-github-runner\">connect</a> to the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#container-optimized-os\">Google COS Instance</a>.

In the table above, gauge couplings are listed as free parameters, therefore with this choice the Weinberg angle is not a free parameter\n- The solution to both these problems comes from the Higgs mechanism, which involves scalar fields (the number of which depend on the exact form of Higgs mechanism) which (to give the briefest possible description) are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom, and which couple to the fermions via ***Yukawa coupling*** to create what looks like mass terms.\n\nThe next step is to ***couple the gauge fields to the fermions***, allowing for interactions. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6f/e3/f0/b8f7292f1f2749/DE102011101032A9.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png\" alt=\"Euler's identity\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner\">The GitHub Runner</a> you can <a href=\"https://github.com/tcardonne/docker-github-runner\">connect</a> to the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#container-optimized-os\">Google COS Instance</a>.

We have presented an improved Bajard-Imbert-type full RNS algorithm that can also operate on inputs represented by pseudo-residues.\n- Using this algorithm, we have developed a multi-layer RNS that is ***capable of implementing modular addition, subtraction and multiplication for very large moduli*** by only using actual arithmetic for a fixed set of moduli. If the moduli of this fixed set are sufficiently small, the method allows for a fully table-based implementation.\n- In contrast to digit-based implementations of modular operations for large moduli, our method allows for a massively parallel implementation and is completely carry- free, thus thwarting potential attacks exploiting such carries, e.g., with side-channel analysis or in a white-box cryptography context.\n- Our system may be considered as a method to provide a given, fixed RNS with a very large dynamical range. To illustrate the method, we have described a 2-layer RNS system that can be used to implement an RSA ***exponentiation by adding the desired RSA modulus on top in a third layer***.\n- The system employs 19 moduli of 8-bits each in the bottom layer and can be used to implement an RSA exponentiation for 2048-bits RSA moduli with all the required arithmetic done by table look-up, using 19 modular addition tables and 19 modular multiplication tables, each of these 38 tables having size 2⁸ × 2⁸ × 8 bits, with one modular multiplication taking approximately 160,000 table look-ups.\n\nWe further observed that in order to change the RSA modulus, only some constants for computing on the top layer with moduli on the middle layer need to be updated. This update need not be computed in a secure manner and hence can be done quickly. _([Recursive Residues - pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>π(π(30+37)) = π(π(67)) = π(19) = 8</em></strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>\n\nedit_file <span class=\"o\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nv\">NUM</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$((</span><span class=\"nv\">$2</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"m\">0</span><span class=\"k\">))</span>\n  \n  <span class=\"k\">while </span><span class=\"nv\">IFS</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">' '</span> <span class=\"nb\">read</span> <span class=\"nt\">-ra</span> SPIN<span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">do\n    </span>T+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[0]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    R+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[1]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    A+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[2]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    C+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[3]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    K+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[4]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    I+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[5]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    N+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[6]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    G+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[7]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">done</span> &lt;

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

It is negative (\"left-handed\") if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.\n- Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)) onto the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)): ***\"left\" is negative, \"right\" is positive.\nhave mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames***.\n- Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory.

It must be highly correlated with the hierarchy of quark flavor mixing.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">This chapter is intended to provide a brief description of some important issues regarding quark masses, flavor mixing and CP-violation. A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 &lt; m2 &lt; m3) or not. Now that m1 &lt; m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 &lt; m1 &lt; m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy. In the lepton sector, however, none of the CP-violating phases has been measured.  _([Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing Puzzles - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14159651/1411.2713.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quark-Mass-Hierarchy-and-Flavor-Mixing-Puzzles-Xing/3719fec87f5e50c70eada23057b4b48fb5de4f18\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/44758746-c069-4fb6-a2e9-8574d2d63b29\" alt=\"CKM vs PMNS\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong><em>3x3 lepton vs quark</em></strong> mixing matrices appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the <strong><em>PMNS matrix U</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>CKM matrix V</em></strong>, which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Muons are about ***200 times heavier*** than the electron.

So in this project we are going to analyze it using a javascript library called <em><a href=\"https://dev.to/codingwithadam/introduction-to-lexers-parsers-and-interpreters-with-chevrotain-5c7b\">Chevrotain</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">There are 3 primary concepts in the diagram. We will start with an intro to lexers (tokenization), parsers, grammars and much more. Then build a simple calculator that uses all these concepts.\n- The lexer which takes input as a string and converts the input into a set of tokens.\n- The Parser which takes the tokens from the lexer and returns a syntax tree based on a grammar. The grammar is often expressed in a meta language such as Backus-Naur Form (BNF). The grammar is the language of languages and provides the rules and syntax.\n- The interpreter which takes in the syntax tree and evaluates the result. In this case we return the result of calculator input.\n\nOther than building a simple calculator using chevrotain the concepts that we will learn here are those that are used to build programming languages like javascript, .net, SQL and much more. Perhaps one day you will make your own language. _[Chevrotain](https://dev.to/codingwithadam/introduction-to-lexers-parsers-and-interpreters-with-chevrotain-5c7b)_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.to/codingwithadam/introduction-to-lexers-parsers-and-interpreters-with-chevrotain-5c7b\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/241206698-b4128e07-81ea-4eab-a14a-5d881836b924.png\" alt=\"Lexers, Parsers and Interpreters with Chevrotain\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Since the <em>modulo 6</em> is occured all over the spin then we have defined that this 4 zones should stand as <strong><em>default configuration</em></strong> as you can see on the left sidebar.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">In order to maintain the 18's structure between each of repositories to correlate with the above density then we could use a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system such as _[windows registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry)_.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/230746478-0146e88e-22ba-4f1b-abf2-c5226c1a56ca.png\" alt=\"windows registry\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Using the javascript library from <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/addition/#structure-minor-hexagons\">Chevotrain</a></em> and data parser from <em><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/\">Jekyll/Liquid</a></em> finally we found the correlation between the lexer and parser trough <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi\">the powers of pi</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In this example, the content from a Markdown document `document.md` that specifies `layout: docs` gets pushed into the `{{ content }}` tag of the layout file `docs.html`.

We have presented an improved Bajard-Imbert-type full RNS algorithm that can also operate on inputs represented by pseudo-residues.\n- Using this algorithm, we have developed a multi-layer RNS that is ***capable of implementing modular addition, subtraction and multiplication for very large moduli*** by only using actual arithmetic for a fixed set of moduli. If the moduli of this fixed set are sufficiently small, the method allows for a fully table-based implementation.\n- In contrast to digit-based implementations of modular operations for large moduli, our method allows for a massively parallel implementation and is completely carry- free, thus thwarting potential attacks exploiting such carries, e.g., with side-channel analysis or in a white-box cryptography context.\n- Our system may be considered as a method to provide a given, fixed RNS with a very large dynamical range. To illustrate the method, we have described a 2-layer RNS system that can be used to implement an RSA ***exponentiation by adding the desired RSA modulus on top in a third layer***.\n- The system employs 19 moduli of 8-bits each in the bottom layer and can be used to implement an RSA exponentiation for 2048-bits RSA moduli with all the required arithmetic done by table look-up, using 19 modular addition tables and 19 modular multiplication tables, each of these 38 tables having size 2⁸ × 2⁸ × 8 bits, with one modular multiplication taking approximately 160,000 table look-ups.\n\nWe further observed that in order to change the RSA modulus, only some constants for computing on the top layer with moduli on the middle layer need to be updated. This update need not be computed in a secure manner and hence can be done quickly. _([Recursive Residues - pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>π(π(30+37)) = π(π(67)) = π(19) = 8</em></strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>\n\nedit_file <span class=\"o\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nv\">NUM</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$((</span><span class=\"nv\">$2</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"m\">0</span><span class=\"k\">))</span>\n  \n  <span class=\"k\">while </span><span class=\"nv\">IFS</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">' '</span> <span class=\"nb\">read</span> <span class=\"nt\">-ra</span> SPIN<span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">do\n    </span>T+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[0]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    R+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[1]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    A+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[2]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    C+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[3]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    K+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[4]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    I+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[5]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    N+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[6]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    G+<span class=\"o\">=(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"k\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">SPIN</span><span class=\"p\">[7]</span><span class=\"k\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">done</span> &lt;

This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a mass, carry a charge, and represent the flow of charge as a current, and perhaps most importantly, to carry angular momentum. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>((3+3) + 2x(3x3)) x 4 = (3 + 3 + 18) x 4 = 24 x 4 = 96 components</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">  Fermion  | spinors | charged | neutrinos |   quark   | components\n   Field   |   (s)   |   (c)   |    (n)    | (q=s.c.n) |  Σ(c+n+q)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============\nbispinor-1 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------ } 48\nbispinor-2 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+===========\nbispinor-3 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------ } 48\nbispinor-4 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============\n     Total |    8    |   12    |    12     |    72     |     96\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>Thus fermion is constructed out of eight (8) spinors that brings the total of 96 components consist of <strong><em>12 charged leptons, 12 neutrinos and 72 quarks</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"free-parameters\">Free Parameters</h2>\n\n<p>The physical evolution of neutrino parameters with respect to energy scale may help elucidate the mechanism for their mass generation.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The most general Lagrangian with massless neutrinos, one finds that the dynamics depend on ***19 parameters***, whose numerical values are established by experiment.\n\n- The 19 certain parameters are summarized below:\n[![IMG_20231230_232603](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/2b4f5d82-d000-46f0-91ee-618ff55f01a4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_the_Standard_Model#Free_parameters)\n- The neutrino parameter values are still uncertain.\n- The value of the [vacuum energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy) (or more precisely, the [renormalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization) scale used to calculate this energy) may also be treated as an additional free parameter.\n\nThe renormalization scale may be identified with the [Planck scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale) or fine-tuned to match the observed [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant).

In the table above, gauge couplings are listed as free parameters, therefore with this choice the Weinberg angle is not a free parameter.\n- Instead of fermion masses, dimensionless Yukawa couplings can be chosen as free parameters. For example, the electron mass depends on the Yukawa coupling of the electron to the Higgs field.\n- The value of the [vacuum energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy) (or more precisely, the [renormalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization) scale used to calculate this energy) may also be treated as ***an additional free parameter***.\n- The renormalization scale may be identified with the [Planck scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale) or fine-tuned to match the observed [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant).

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/70cb2eb0-0955-4d18-8400-e05ac1b9d325\" alt=\"Symmetry State\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Standard Model with massive neutrinos need <strong><em>7 more parameters</em></strong> (3 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo%E2%80%93Kobayashi%E2%80%93Maskawa_matrix\">CKM</a> and 4 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMNS_matrix\">PMNS matrix</a> parameters) for a total of <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/15.html#parity-order\">26 parameters</a></em>.

It can even be useful to renormalize these \"nonrenormalizable\" interactions.[![multiplication zones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/195963923-0796217c-7a87-4b2d-ba93-f47465304c03.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)\n- Nonrenormalizable interactions in effective field theories rapidly become weaker as the energy scale becomes much smaller than the cutoff.

A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 &lt; m2 &lt; m3) or not. Now that m1 &lt; m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 &lt; m1 &lt; m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy. In the lepton sector, however, none of the CP-violating phases has been measured.  _([Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing Puzzles - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14159651/1411.2713.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quark-Mass-Hierarchy-and-Flavor-Mixing-Puzzles-Xing/3719fec87f5e50c70eada23057b4b48fb5de4f18\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/44758746-c069-4fb6-a2e9-8574d2d63b29\" alt=\"CKM vs PMNS\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong><em>3x3 lepton vs quark</em></strong> mixing matrices appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the <strong><em>PMNS matrix U</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>CKM matrix V</em></strong>, which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Muons are about ***200 times heavier*** than the electron.

We will start with an intro to lexers (tokenization), parsers, grammars and much more. Then build a simple calculator that uses all these concepts.\n- The lexer which takes input as a string and converts the input into a set of tokens.\n- The Parser which takes the tokens from the lexer and returns a syntax tree based on a grammar.

Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.\n\nThe basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:\n- If an event can occur via a number of indistinguishable alternative processes (a.k.a. \"virtual\" processes), then its probability amplitude is the ***sum of the probability amplitudes of the alternatives***.\n- If a virtual process involves a number of independent or concomitant sub-processes, then the probability amplitude of the total (compound) process is the ***product of the probability amplitudes of the sub-processes***.\n\nThe indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is no observable feature present in the given system that in any way \"reveals\" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13930690/PhysRev.76.769.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/c381a212-cf38-45db-a166-f8e8716886da\" alt=\"First_Feynman_Diagram\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">It should be remembered that the expression hides a lot of complexity.

This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/22d4a42b-da13-4a78-a3d1-e15ee5c611c6\" alt=\"Cut the Standard Model\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">We may gain a better understanding of black hole physics; wewe may gain the insight that tunneling electrons enter the event horizons of black holes, absorb a particle there, and tunnel out again to deposit it into the background.

The famous 3R experiment also suggests that whatever force binds the quarks together has 3 types of charge (called the 3 colors).\n- Now, into the realm of theory: we are looking for an internal symmetry having a 3-dimensional representation which can give rise to a neutral combination of 3 particles (otherwise no color-neutral baryons).\n-  The simplest such statement is that a linear combination of each type of charge (red + green + blue) must be neutral, and following William of Occam we believe that the simplest theory describing all the facts must be the correct one.\n-  We now postulate that the particles carrying this force, called gluons, must occur in color anti-color units (i.e. nine of them).\n- BUT, red + blue + green is neutral, which means that the linear combination red anti-red + blue anti-blue + green anti-green must be non-interacting, since otherwise the colorless baryons would be able to emit these gluons and interact with each other via the strong force—contrary to the evidence.  So, there can only be ***EIGHT gluons***.\n\nThis is just Occam's razor again: a hypothetical particle that can't interact with anything, and therefore can't be detected, doesn't exist. The simplest theory describing the above is the SU(3) one with the gluons as the basis states of the Lie algebra.  That is, gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional. _([Physics FAQ](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/dbb91090-dcb6-4ad9-bcb6-427054eab4dc\" alt=\"0_kGdCmWqcFG_s8fIq\" /></p>\n\n<p>Please note that we are not talking about the number of 19 which is the 8th prime.

They span the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#SU(3)) group in the defining representation.\n- These matrices are [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceless), [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix), and obey the extra trace orthonormality relation (so they can generate [unitary matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix) group elements of [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(3)) through [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential)[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)). These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) for [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2)) to SU(3), which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-2) Gell-Mann's generalization further [extends to general SU(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices#Construction). For their connection to the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system) of Lie algebras, see the [Weyl–Cartan basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Standard_basis).\n- Since the eight matrices and the identity are a complete trace-orthogonal set spanning all 3×3 matrices, it is straightforward to find two Fierz completeness relations, (Li &amp; Cheng, 4.134), analogous to that [satisfied by the Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Completeness_relation_2). Namely, using the dot to sum over the eight matrices and using Greek indices for their row/column indices\n- A particular choice of matrices is called a [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation), because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form using the ***[Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation)***, where the eight \n are real numbers and a sum over the index j is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.\n- The matrices can be realized as a representation of the [infinitesimal generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group) called [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3)). The [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) generators, which can be written as \ng_{i}, with i taking values from [1 to 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)\n\nThese matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the ***[gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) (cf.

The famous 3R experiment also suggests that whatever force binds the quarks together has 3 types of charge (called the 3 colors).\n- Now, into the realm of theory: we are looking for an internal symmetry having a 3-dimensional representation which can give rise to a neutral combination of 3 particles (otherwise no color-neutral baryons).\n-  The simplest such statement is that a linear combination of each type of charge (red + green + blue) must be neutral, and following William of Occam we believe that the simplest theory describing all the facts must be the correct one.\n-  We now postulate that the particles carrying this force, called gluons, must occur in color anti-color units (i.e. nine of them).\n- BUT, red + blue + green is neutral, which means that the linear combination red anti-red + blue anti-blue + green anti-green must be non-interacting, since otherwise the colorless baryons would be able to emit these gluons and interact with each other via the strong force—contrary to the evidence.  So, there can only be ***EIGHT gluons***.\n\nThis is just Occam's razor again: a hypothetical particle that can't interact with anything, and therefore can't be detected, doesn't exist. The simplest theory describing the above is the SU(3) one with the gluons as the basis states of the Lie algebra.  That is, gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional. _([Physics FAQ](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/dbb91090-dcb6-4ad9-bcb6-427054eab4dc\" alt=\"0_kGdCmWqcFG_s8fIq\" /></p>\n\n<p>Please note that we are not talking about the number of 19 which is the 8th prime.

Illustration of two weak reactions.\n- The left panel shows beta decay while the middle panel shows how electron antineutrinos can be detected by conversion to a positron.\n- The right panel shows how W- emission works according to the quark model, ***resulting in the conversion of a down quark to an up quark and the resulting transformation of a neutron into a proton***.\n\nThe real reason for the apparent weakness of the weak force is the large mass of the intermediary particles. As we have seen, large mass translates into short range for a virtual particle at low momentum transfers. This short range is what causes the weak force to appear weak for momentum transfers much less than the masses of the W and Z particles. _([libre texts.org](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Radically_Modern_Introductory_Physics_Text_II_(Raymond)/20%3A_The_Standard_Model/20.03%3A_The_Electroweak_Theory))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-27-20-28350&amp;id=420769\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/e4a41d26-7ffd-43f2-9ff8-fc3abfe4247c\" alt=\"Beta decay\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">$True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7$True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n     |    168    |    618    |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                                             ---\n 19¨ |  3¨ |  4¨ |  6¨ |  6¨ | 4¤  -----&gt;  assigned to \"id:30\"             19¨\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                                             ---\n 17¨ | {5¨}| {3¨}|  2¨ |  7¨ | 4¤  -----&gt;  assigned to \"id:31\"              |\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+                                              |\n{12¨}|  6¨ |  6¨ |  2¤ (M &amp; F)     -----&gt;  assigned to \"id:32\"              |\n     +-----+-----+-----+                                                    |\n 11¨ |  3¨ | {3¨}| {5¨}| 3¤  ---&gt;  Np(33)  assigned to \"id:33\"  -----&gt;  👉 77¨\n-----+-----+-----+----+-----+                                              |\n 19¨ |  4¨ |  4¨ |  5¨ |  6¨ | 4¤ ✔️ ---&gt;  assigned to \"id:34\"              |\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+                                              |\n{18¨}|  .. |  .. |  .. | 3¤        -----&gt;  assigned to \"id:35\"              |\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+               ---\n 43¨ |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. | 9¤ (C1 &amp; C2)  43¨\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+               ---\n139¨ |  1     2     3  |  4     5     6  |  7     8     9  |\n                    Δ                 Δ                 Δ       \n</code></pre>  \n\n<h2 id=\"problem\">Problem</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Consider the following contradiction in the electroweak theory of the Standard Model.\n\nThe electroweak theory of neutrino interaction uses factors like  in order to account for a complete parity violation. This factor implies a massless neutrino [1]: “Nature had the choice of an aesthetically satisfying, but a left-right, symmetry violating theory, with a neutrino which travels exactly with the same velocity of light; or alternatively a theory where left-right symmetry is preserved, but the neutrino has a tiny mass – some ten thousand times smaller than the mass of the electron.”\nThe neutrino masslessness is also stated by other authors. A review article on neutrino properties states that “two-components left-handed massless neutrino fields play a crucial role in the determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model” (see the Abstract of [2]). Similarly, a Quantum Field Theory textbook states: “Thus, massless neutrinos are a prediction of the Standard Model” (see [4], p. 555). Indeed, a massless neutrino is the basis for the two-component Weyl neutrino, which shows parity violation (see e.g. section 2.2 of [2]). The same argument appears on p. 139 of [3].\n\nOn the other hand, a recent review article negates the foregoing ides and states that it is now admitted “that neutrinos can no longer be considered as massless particles” (see [5], p. 1307). This statement is adopted by the Particle Data Group [6], which is the authorized organization for the definition of reliable particle data. The recognition of this fact by the community was demonstrated by the 2015 Nobel Prize, awarded to the persons who have discovered this property [7].\nIt follows that the experimentally confirmed massive neutrino undermines the basis of the Standard Model electroweak theory, since the massless neutrino is a crucial element in this theory.\n\nResearch topic: Can the validity of the electroweak theory be restored?\n\nRemark: Further  contradictions are discussed in [8]. _([Research Topics](https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/79b02bf3-6e4f-427c-897b-8d58de8e4c13\" alt=\"A Problem with the Electroweak Theory\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\nTabulate Prime by Power of 10\nloop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4\nloop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19\nloop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114\n\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n True Prime Pairs → Δ→π  |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n 19 → π(∆10) → π(10)     |  2 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 4th  4 x Root\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 17 → π(10+∆9) → π(19)   | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 8th  4 x Twin\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n 13 → π(19+∆10) → π(29)  | 23 | 29 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |10th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 11 → π(29+∆12) → π(41)  | 31 | 37 | 41 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |13th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n  7 → π(41+∆18) → π(59)  | 43 | 47 | 53 | 59 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |17th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----- 3rd Twin\n  5 → π(59+∆13) → π(72)  | 61 | 67 | 71 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |20th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 4th Twin\n  3,2 → 18+13+12 → 43    | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n         Δ                                                            Δ\n12+13+(18+18)+13+12   ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)   ←   30th = 113 = 114-\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>How do you resolve Maxwell equations as euler-lagrange equation without electromagnetic electromagnetism, lagrangian formalism, field theory, Maxwell equations, variational principle potential.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Axial (e-e rES repulsions blue aggregating to black axial outward, vs weak axial inward) to generate the Bose “cylinder surface” proof of statistical mechanics.\n- Axial View of one hemisphere set of one subshell (N,1,many,-1/2) quantum number example below:\n- That gives the path from Planck strength to the Maxwell strengths. Those are not independent, but all based upon h (or h-hat*c version in this case).\n- Yes, I used Euler to get there! The weakness of the Lagrangian is that introduces errors in (a0/re)N scaling ^2 vs ^3 (extra 1/r wrongly called angular momentum by Bohr) that introduces an error correction. Hence, circling back to QED methods of error-correction (loops, re-normalization).\n\nSo, in the end, you do need.

This factor implies a massless neutrino [1]: “Nature had the choice of an aesthetically satisfying, but a left-right, symmetry violating theory, with a neutrino which travels exactly with the same velocity of light; or alternatively a theory where left-right symmetry is preserved, but the neutrino has a tiny mass – some ten thousand times smaller than the mass of the electron.”\nThe neutrino masslessness is also stated by other authors. A review article on neutrino properties states that “two-components left-handed massless neutrino fields play a crucial role in the determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model” (see the Abstract of [2]). Similarly, a Quantum Field Theory textbook states: “Thus, massless neutrinos are a prediction of the Standard Model” (see [4], p. 555). Indeed, a massless neutrino is the basis for the two-component Weyl neutrino, which shows parity violation (see e.g. section 2.2 of [2]). The same argument appears on p. 139 of [3].\n\nOn the other hand, a recent review article negates the foregoing ides and states that it is now admitted “that neutrinos can no longer be considered as massless particles” (see [5], p. 1307). This statement is adopted by the Particle Data Group [6], which is the authorized organization for the definition of reliable particle data. The recognition of this fact by the community was demonstrated by the 2015 Nobel Prize, awarded to the persons who have discovered this property [7].\nIt follows that the experimentally confirmed massive neutrino undermines the basis of the Standard Model electroweak theory, since the massless neutrino is a crucial element in this theory.\n\nResearch topic: Can the validity of the electroweak theory be restored?\n\nRemark: Further  contradictions are discussed in [8]. _([Research Topics](https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/79b02bf3-6e4f-427c-897b-8d58de8e4c13\" alt=\"A Problem with the Electroweak Theory\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">The True Prime Pairs\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\nTabulate Prime by Power of 10\nloop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4\nloop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19\nloop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114\n\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n True Prime Pairs → Δ→π  |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | Sum \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n 19 → π(∆10) → π(10)     |  2 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 4th  4 x Root\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 17 → π(10+∆9) → π(19)   | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - | 8th  4 x Twin\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n 13 → π(19+∆10) → π(29)  | 23 | 29 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |10th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 11 → π(29+∆12) → π(41)  | 31 | 37 | 41 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |13th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n  7 → π(41+∆18) → π(59)  | 43 | 47 | 53 | 59 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |17th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----- 3rd Twin\n  5 → π(59+∆13) → π(72)  | 61 | 67 | 71 |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |  - |20th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 4th Twin\n  3,2 → 18+13+12 → 43    | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n         Δ                                                            Δ\n12+13+(18+18)+13+12   ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12)   ←   30th = 113 = 114-\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>How do you resolve Maxwell equations as euler-lagrange equation without electromagnetic electromagnetism, lagrangian formalism, field theory, Maxwell equations, variational principle potential.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Axial (e-e rES repulsions blue aggregating to black axial outward, vs weak axial inward) to generate the Bose “cylinder surface” proof of statistical mechanics.\n- Axial View of one hemisphere set of one subshell (N,1,many,-1/2) quantum number example below:\n- That gives the path from Planck strength to the Maxwell strengths. Those are not independent, but all based upon h (or h-hat*c version in this case).\n- Yes, I used Euler to get there! The weakness of the Lagrangian is that introduces errors in (a0/re)N scaling ^2 vs ^3 (extra 1/r wrongly called angular momentum by Bohr) that introduces an error correction. Hence, circling back to QED methods of error-correction (loops, re-normalization).\n\nSo, in the end, you do need.

Similar issue is present in the usual Kaluza–Klein scenarios where one needs to provide a mechanism for _[spontaneous compactification](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure)_. We note, however, that the situation in theory (4) is somewhat better than in the usual KK setup. In the latter case, apart from the case of compactification on S1, the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions usually does not have solutions of the form of the product of Minkowski spacetime and (compact) internal manifolds. For this reason one usually extends the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions with extra fields, e.g. by considering the Einstein–Yang–Mills system. The stress–energy tensor of these extra fields then allows for solutions of the required product form, see e.g. [20], Section 3. Probably the most famous compactification mechanism is that due to Freund and Rubin [21], where the 3-form field of the 11D supergravity is doing the job. In contrast, the theory (4) admits the solution that is the S3 fibration over S4, see [14] for an explicit description. Thus, at least there is a solution of (4) of the desired type without having to introduce extra fields. However, the cosmological constant for the S3 fibration over S4 solution is too large, see [14]. This is similar to the situation with the Freund–Rubin solution. Thus, a compactification mechanism that would result in an appropriately small cosmological constant is a very serious open issue for our setup. It is possible that the only way forward is to add other fields. We then remark that there is a very natural extension of the theory (4) that adds forms of all odd degrees. This is the theory that appeared in [12], formula (29). It would be interesting to study 4D compactifications of this more general theory. We hope to analyse this in the future.\n- Another open problem of the present approach is that of coupling to matter. Again, a natural way to proceed is suggested by supergravity. One does not couple supergravity to extra fields, one simply studies what the modes already present become when viewed from the 4D perspective. In particular, when compactifying on a coset manifold all modes related to isometries of the internal space are known to be important. Indeed, recall that the gauge group that arises in the KK compactification is the group of isometries of the internal manifold, and its dimension may be larger than the dimension of the internal space itself. In this paper we have considered a compactification on a group manifold, but only retained half of the relevant isometries by considering the invariant dimensional reduction ansatz. It is clear that additional fields will arise by enlarging the ansatz by taking into account all the isometries. In this case, however, one must be careful about _[the issue of consistent truncation](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#undiscovered-features)_, see e.g. [22] for a clear description of all the issues arising. We leave a study of the dimensional reduction on S3 viewed as a coset S3 = SO(4)/SO(3) to future research.\n- Third, there is a question of how to describe Lorentzian signature metrics using this formalism. To do this one must make the 3-form C complex-valued, and then impose some appropriate reality conditions. Similar issues exist in all Plebanski-related formulations. We postpone their resolution to future work.\nFinally, to avoid confusion, we would like to say that our present use of G2 structures (3-forms in 7D) is different from what one can find in the literature on Kaluza–Klein compactifications of supergravity.\n\nIn our approach a 3-form is not an object that exist in addition to the metric — it is the only object that exist. The metric, and in particular the 4D metric, is defined by the 3-forvia (2). Also, in the supergravity context a 7D manifold with a G2 structure is used for compactifying the 11D supergravity down to 4D. In contrast, we compactify from 7D to 4D. _([General relativity from three-forms in seven dimensions - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14064088/1-s2.0-S0370269317304926-main.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/8/993\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ffcf7817-4cd8-4383-8bdc-abec8d07c948\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When describing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime\">spacetime</a> as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined\">well-defined</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">To define them, or make them unambiguous, a [continuum limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_limit) must carefully remove \"construction scaffolding\" of lattices at various scales.\n- Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values. That is, the experimental value of the physical quantity yields practical applications, but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represents areas of quantum field theory that require deeper derivation from theoretical bases.\n- Renormalization was first developed in [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics) (QED) to make sense of [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) integrals in [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)).\n- Initially viewed as a suspect provisional procedure even by some of its originators, renormalization eventually was embraced as an important and [self-consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-consistent) actual mechanism of scale [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) in several fields of physics and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics). \n\nDespite his later skepticism, it was [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac) who pioneered renormalization. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6153\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/c6364322-cc8c-47d2-aaad-efd2e835911f\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Numerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects.

Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.\n- The octonions are 8-dimensional. The [E8 lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice) can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).\n- The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_object#cite_note-19) further, the E8 algebra is related to the E8 lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).\n- Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8 · 3  = 24.Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.\n- Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster. The exceptional [Jordan algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_algebra) has a representation in terms of 24×24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.\n- These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves \"exceptional\". For example, in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology), 8-fold real [Bott periodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bott_periodicity) can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_forms), the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [Dedekind eta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function) and the [modular discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_discriminant), which connection is deepened by [Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine), a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.\n\nIn [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena.

The dimensionality of space-time plays a paramount role in the theoretical physics of unification and has led to the introduction of the 26 dimensions of string theory, the 10 dimensions of superstring theory, and finally the heterotic string theory with the dimensional hierarchy 4, 6, 10, 16 and 26\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/11/15/another-look-at-integrating-the-pascal-triangle-to-clifford-algebra-e8-lie-algebragroups-octonions-and-particle-physics-standard-model/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/bafeea01-1add-4546-96de-21213950cad6\" alt=\"Pascal Octonion\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Each of the 6 columns has <strong><em>8 bilateral 360 sums</em></strong>, tor a total of 48 * 360 = 40 * 432.

El Nachie.\n- This theory provides a fractal model of quantum space-time, the so-called E-infinity space, that allows the precise determination of the mass-energy of most elementary particles -and much more- in close agreement with their experimental values.\n- The [Golden Ratio](https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/golden-ratio) emerges naturally in this theory, and ***turns out to be the central piece*** that connects the fractal dimension of quantum space-time with the mass-energy of every fundamental particle, and also with several fundamental physical quantities such as the Fine Structure constant.\n- El Nachie has been severely criticised by his non-orthodoxal publication methods -he uses to publish his papers in a Journal where he is the editor in chief. Despite this fact, I think that his theory deserves consideration so I will try to summarize it in the lines that follow.\n- The intervention of the Golden Ratio can be seen as a way to enter the quantum world, the world of subtle vibrations, in which we observe increasing energy levels as we move to smaller and smaller scales.\n- El Nachie has proposed a way of calculating the fractal dimension of quantum space-time. The resulting value (Figure 7) suggests that the quantum world is composed of an infinite number or scaled copies of our ordinary 4-dimensional space-time.\n- Setting k=0 one obtains the classical dimensions of ***heterotic superstring theory***, namely 26, 16, 10, 6 and 4, as well as the constant of super-symmetric (αgs=26) and ***non super-symmetric (αg=42) unification of all fundamental forces***.\n\nAs we have seen in section 2, the above is a Fibonacci-like sequence with a very concise geometrical interpetation related to numbers ***5, 11 and φ***. _([Phi in Particle Physics](https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/phi-particle-physics))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/phi-particle-physics\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6d91e9b8-9fc7-4ab9-9ec9-6e87a6f70c99\" alt=\"PHI_Quantum_SpaceTime\" /></a></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\"> Majorana  | spinors | charged | neutrinos |   quark   | components | parameter\n  Fields   |   (s)   |   (c)   |    (n)    | (q=s.c.n) |  Σ(c+n+q   | (complex)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nmajorana-1 |   2x2   |    -    |    ❓     |     -     |     ❓     |   ❓\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-2 |   2x2   |    -    |    ❓     |     -     |     ❓     |   ❓\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-3 |   2x2   |    -    |    13 ✔️  |     -     |     13 ✔️  |   i13 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n     Total |   12    |    -    |    43     |     -     |     43     |  30+i13\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>The particle spectrum is completed by the Higgs particles required to give masses to fermions as well as to break the GUT symmetry.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-metatrons-cube\">The Metatron’s Cube</h2>\n\n<p>Geometrically, a transformation matrix rotates, stretches, or shears the vectors it acts upon.

Then:\n- While gluons may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of gluons in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by = 0 dG , and the invariance of F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While quarks may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by the invariance of P → P'= P under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface, there can indeed be a net flux of quark-antiquark pairs in to or out of any closed surface.\n- The antiquark cancels the quark, thereby averting a net flux, and in this way, quarks do flow in to or out of the closed surface, but only paired with antiquarks, as mesons.\n- This may possibly be represented as 02 ≠ i gG .\n- It does not matter how hard or in what manner one “smashes” a baryon, one can still never extract a net flux of quarks or a net flux of gluons, but only a large number of meson jets.\n- This may be possibly represented by the fact that in all of the foregoing, the volume and surface\nintegrals apply to any and all closed surfaces.\n- One can choose a small closed surface, a large closed surface, a spherical closed surface, an oblong closed surface, and indeed, a closed surface of any shape and size. The choice of closed surface does not matter.\n- These mathematical rules for what does and does not flow across any closed surface, in fact, thereby impose very stringent dynamical constraints on the behaviors of these non-Abelian magnetic sources: No matter what flows across various open surfaces, they may never be a net flux of anything across any closed\nsurface.

The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 &amp; 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).\n- Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].\n- Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of [Prime Spiral Sieve](https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve)) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.\n\nAnd when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing ***three (3) rotations*** around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. _([PrimesDemystified](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219261961-10e4d77f-ead3-43d4-9407-f01d83f1f204.png\" alt=\"Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These include generating variants of their abundance profile, assigning taxonomy and finally generating a rooted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\">phylogenetic tree</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#three-3-layers\">Standard Model</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Here is an elegant model to define the elementary particles of the Standard Model in Physics.\n- The black spheres are the bosons, the green ones leptons and the rest of the colored ones Murray Gell-Mann’s quarks (red for Generation I, blue for II and orange for III).\n- Higgs Boson (aka the God particle) that does not have charge is the vertex between the matter and anti-matter particles.\n- The z-boson and its counterpart would lie in the centroids of the tetrahedrons created by folding the triangles to meet up at the Higgs particle.\n\nThe next step is to re-gigg the model to account for the collisions and annihilations.

The A4HTM is a four-Higgs- Triplet-Model (δ of 1 and (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) of 3).\n- Four mass eigenstates of [doubly charged](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13276480_Higgs_triplets_in_the_standard_model) Higgs bosons, H±±i, are obtained explicitly from the Higgs potential.\n- We also obtained four mass eigenstates of the triplet-like singly charged Higgs bosons, H±T i, for which doublet components can be ignored because of small triplet vev’s.\n- It was shown that the A4HTM gives unique predictions about their decay branching ratios into two leptons (H−−i → ℓℓ′ and H−iT → ℓν); for example, the leptonic decays of H−−2 are only into µµ and eτ because an approximate Z3 symmetry remains, and the ratio of the branching ratios is 2 : 1 as a consequence of the A4 symmetry in the original Lagrangian.\n- Therefore, it will be possible to test the model at hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC) if some of these Higgs bosons are light enough to be produced.\n- Even if these Higgs bosons are too heavy to be produced at hadron colliders, they can affect the lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons if the triplet Yukawa coupling constants are large enough.\n- It was shown that there is no contribution of these Higgs bosonsto µ → eee ¯ and ℓ → ℓ′γ.\n- Thus, we can naturally expect signals of τ → µee and τ → eµµ(which are possible in this model among six τ → ℓℓ′ℓ′′) in the future in collider experiments (Super-KEKB, super B factory, super flavor factory, and LHCb) without interfering with a stringent experimental bound on µ → eee ¯ . This model will be excluded if ℓ → ℓ ′γ is observed.\n\nWe considered current experimental constraints on the model and prospects of the measurement of the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in the neutrino factory. If H±±2 or H±±3 is lighter enough than other H±±i, effects of the NSI can be around the expected sensitivity in the neutrino factory. _([Triplet Higgs bosons - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14442049/1005.5338.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://studylib.net/doc/5775531/phenomenology-of-the-higgs-triplet-model\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/e3b14f7a-bd2a-4dcc-b97f-30ad329458a0\" alt=\"how-we-can-constrain-various-higgs-sectors1-l\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Assigning a specific mass, length, time, and charge metrics based on new dimensional relationships and the Planck constant (<strong><em>which defines Higgs mass</em></strong>).</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The discovery of [neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation) indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete, but there is currently no clear evidence that nature is described by any _[Grand Unified Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory)_.

The light SU(2)L triplet Higgs required by the gauge coupling unification can be realized consistently within the framework of SU(5) grand unified theory (see Appendix B).\n- This complex triplet Higgs contains one CP-even Heavy Higgs, one CP-odd Higgs and two charged Higgs bosons, which could be the smoking gun single of this scenario.\n- Although the unification scale around 1014 GeV is too low, in the usual sense, leading to significant proton decay constraints, we have shown that the constrains can be avoided by introducing additional vector-like fermions which mix with the SM fermions through an SU(5) breaking mass term.\n- Importantly, the minimal requirement is quite simple and only requires the addition of a single pair of 10 and 10 fermions to mix with the first generation 10 matter multiplet.\n- To get enough suppression in the proton decay rate, the SU(2)L singlet quark should have significant mixing with the vector-like fermion while SU(2) doublet quark should have almost zero mixing with it (or vice versa).\n- Interestingly, this leads to a suppression in the proton decay mediated by X gauge bosons but leads to a significant enhancement in the proton decay through the colored Higgs boson. This means that if nature is realized by this minimal model, it is bound to show up in proton decay experiments eventually.\n- Although this model has some additional fine tuning, the fine-tuning of the fermion masses is similar in nature to the doublet-triplet splitting present in all GUT models. \n\nSince the fine-tuning for all the fields in our model, including the light complex SU(2)L triplet, are similar in design to the doublet-triplet splitting, it is possible that all the required tuning of this GUT theory is solved by a single lmechanism, e.g. product group unification scenarios. _([W boson mass anomaly and grand unification - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14412652/2205.03877.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>the 12 fermions and 5 bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">  Fermion  | spinors | charged | neutrinos |   quark   | components | parameter\n   Field   |   (s)   |   (c)   |    (n)    | (q=s.c.n) |  Σ(c+n+q   | (complex)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-1 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   19\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 17\nbispinor-2 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   i12 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-3 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   11\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 19\nbispinor-4 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   i18 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n  SubTotal |    8    |   12    |    12     |    72     |     96     |   66+i30\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nmajorana-1 |   2x2   |    -    |    18     |     -     |     18     |   18 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-2 |   2x2   |    -    |    12     |     -     |     12     |   12 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-3 |   2x2   |    -    |    13     |     -     |     13     |   i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n  SubTotal |    12   |    -    |    43     |     -     |     43     |  30+i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n     Total |    20   |   12    |    55     |    72     |    139     |  96+i43 ✔️\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>Since the total of parameters is <strong><em>66+i30</em></strong> then according to <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization\">renormalization theory</a></em> the 12 boson fields should have the total complex value of <strong><em>30+i66</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beyond-the-139\">Beyond the 139</h2>\n\n<p>Similarly the Standard Model incorporates three generations of quarks, so its fermionic content can be summarized.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In addition, the Standard Model involves gauge bosons (photons for the electromagnetic interaction, W and Z for the weak interaction, and ***eight (8) gluons*** for the strong interaction), plus the (scalar) Higgs particle.

This is on account of the overwhelmingly large background contribution from a number of other SM processes that can mimic its experimental signature characterized by the appearance of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark.\n\nThe CMS Collaboration overcame this challenge by deploying modern sophisticated analysis tools and by focusing on particular signatures where a Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson V (a W or Z particle), a weak interaction process known as VH(bb), shown in the figure below, leading to a significant reduction in the background. _([CERN](https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/36b73f3c-fc47-428e-9d90-7f6f1c1e361a\" alt=\"down-type quark\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Study of connections between neutrino phenomenology and leptogenesis shows the patterns of symmetry breaking from SO10 to the Standard Model gauge group.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Since right-handed neutrinos appear naturally in the grand unified model based on the group SO(10) [5], it is of interest to discuss leptogenesis under the constraints suggested by such a model.\n- It turns out, however, that such constraints render a successful leptogenesis extremely difficult to obtain.\n- This happens because, unless a fine tuning on the neutrino mass parameters is introduced, the right-handed neutrinos become very hierarchical in mass, with the lowest mass being too small to allow for leptogenesis. \n\nA compactness in the right-handed neutrino mass spectrum is, however, able to overcome this difficulty and achieve a consistent leptogenesis. _([Neutrino Phenomenology and Leptogenesis - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/fc850392-b83d-459d-9769-094843d447aa\" alt=\"Patterns-of-symmetry-breaking-from-SO10-to-the-Standard-Model-gauge-group\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We have found that if the intermediate scales induced by the soft SUSY breaking sector the model <strong><em>contains three families</em></strong> of vector-like leptons within the reach of LHC measurements or future High-Energy/High-Luminosity LHC upgrades.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Our framework features the minimum of three (and maximum of five) light Higgs doublets at the electroweak scale providing a Cabibbo mixing consistent with the top-charm and bottom-strange mass hierarchies as well as massless first-generation quarks at tree-level. _([Prospects for new physics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/220b1111-2b0e-454a-a56f-602de2a84afc\" alt=\"10052_2020_8710_Fig1_HTML\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of one-loop corrections with mild hierarchies supply the necessary ingredients to potentially generate realistic quark masses and mixing angles.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The present particle physics or standard model based on the \"unreal gauge transformation symmetry\" and meaningless math cannot explain any actual physical mechanism at all _([biglobe.ne.jp](https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/f351b6d2-753a-45e4-8e26-f06a822db06f\" alt=\"hsta1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Thus it appears that the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/#RSPA20200786C24\">cosmological models</a> derived from compactification of 11d supergravity on a manifold with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/\">G2 holonomy</a> have some <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups\">hidden E7 symmetry</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-77-principles\">The 77 Principles</h2>\n\n<p>Using this concept we are going to stimulate a model of <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions\">the 11 dimensions</a> through the rank of their partition using github organizations of 13 repositories each.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">Each of the user profiles will have ***seven (7) user repositories*** consist of one (1) main of [`github.io`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and six (6) user pinned repositories.

Thus the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass provide a further impetus for the search for sparticles to continue at the current and future colliders.\n- The group SO(10) as the framework for grand unification appears preferred over SU(5). The group SO(10) contains both G(4, 2, 2) and SU(5)⊗U(1) as subgroups, i.e., SO(10) has the branchings SO(10) → SU(4)C ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ SU(2)R and SO(10) → SU(5) ⊗ U(1).[![Mystery of the First 1000 Prime Numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/225830554-007fbd06-9d7d-44e8-867d-c7b0188bf488.png)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)\n- ***It possesses a spinor representation which is 2⁵ = 32 dimensional and which splits into 16 ⊕ 16***. A full generation of quarks and leptons can be accommodated in a single 16 plet representation. Thus the 16 plet has the decomposition in SU(5) ⊗ U(1) so that 16 =10(−1) ⊕ 5(3) ⊕ 1(−5).\n- As noted the combination 5 ⊕ 10 in SU(5) is anomaly free and further 1(−5) in the 16-plet decomposition is a right handed neutrino which is a singlet of the standard model gauge group and thus the 16-plet of matter in SO(10) is anomaly free.\n- The absence of anomaly in this case is the consequence of a more general result for SO(N) gauge theories. Thus in general anomalies arise due to the non-vanishing of the trace over the product of three group generators in some given group representation Tr ({Ta, Tb}Tc).\n- For SO(10) one will have Tr ({Σµν, Σαβ}Σλρ). However, there is no invariant tensor to which the above quantity can be proportional which then automatically guarantees vanishing of the anomaly for SO(10). This analysis extends to other SO(N) groups.\n- ***One exception is SO(6) where there does exist a six index invariant tensor*** ǫµναβλρ and so in this case vanishing of the anomaly is not automatic.\n- The group SO(10) is rank 5 where as the standard model gauge group is rank 4. The rank of the group can be reduced by either using ***16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs fields or 126 ⊕ 126 of Higgs***.\n- Since under SU(5) ⊗ U(1) one has 16 ⊃ 1(−5) we see that a VEV formation for the singlet will reduce the rank of the group. Similarly 126 ⊃ 1(−10) under the above decomposition. Thus when the singlets in 16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs or 126 ⊕ 126 get VEVs, the SO(10) gauge symmetry will break reducing its rank.\n- However, we still need to reduce the remaining group symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group. For this we need to have additional Higgs fields such as 45, 54, 210. Further to get the residual gauge group SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em we need to have 10 -plet of Higgs fields.\n- Thus the breaking of SO(10) down to SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em ***requires at least three (3) sets of Higgs representations***: one to reduce the rank, the second to break the rest of the gauge group to the Standard Model gauge group and then at least one 10-plet to break the electroweak symmetry.[![Higgs fields](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ac0b2608-24b2-4a0d-bae8-55473a8576d9)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04892-x)\n- As discussed above one can do this by a combination of fields from the set: 10, 16 ⊕ 16, 45, 54, 120, 126 ⊕ 126, 210.\n- To generate quark and lepton masses we need to couple two 16-plets of matter with Higgs fields. ***To see which Higgs fields couple we expand the product 16⊗16 as a sum over the irreducible representations of SO(10)***. \n\nHere we have ***16 ⊗ 16 = 10s ⊕ 120a ⊕ 126s***, where the s(a) refer to symmetric (anti-symmetric) under the interchange of the two 16-plets. The array of Higgs bosons available lead to a large number of possible SO(10) models. _([Superunification - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14413665/1709.09718.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(10)\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/012168fa-d2d7-4b8d-a2af-280927eb4aae\" alt=\"SO(10)_-_16_Weight_Diagram svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Below is a powerful <a href=\"https://florianwinkler.at/the-standard-model-o\">cheat sheet</a> which is compiled to provide you with a great overview, not just stuffed with information, but also puts it in relation.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">I am pleased to announce the availability of [splitFano.pdf](https://theoryofeverything.org/TOE/JGM/splitFano.pdf), a 321 page pdf file with the 3840=480*8 [split octonion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion) permutations (with Fano planes and multiplication tables). \n- There are 30 canonical sets of 7 triads indexed with a Fano plane index (fpi) in (16). As in E8 with 16 of the 2⁸ = 256 binary representations excluded from the group, there are 32 excluded octonions from the 2⁹ = 512.\n- As in E8, excluded particles are associated with the color=0, generation=0 (bosons) which are the positive (and negative) generators commonly associated with the 8-orthoplex with 16 permutations of {±1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- These are organized into “flipped” and “non-flipped” pairs associated with the 240 assigned particles to E8 vertices (sorted by Fano plane index or fPi).\n- They are assigned to the [30 canonical sets of 7 triples](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14746885/E8toH4fold.pdf) using the maskList: {5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 3, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 6}\n- There are 7 sets of split octonions for each of the 480 “parent” octonions (each of which is defined by 30 sets of 7 triads and 16 7 bit “sign masks” which reverse the direction of the triad multiplication). The 7 split octonions are identified by selecting a triad.\n- The complement of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and the triad list leaves 4 elements which are the rows/colums corresponding to the negated elements in the multiplication table (highlighted with yellow background).\n- The red arrows in the Fano Plane indicate the potential reversal due to this negation that defines the split octonions. The selected triad nodes are yellow, and the other 4 are cyan (25MB).\n- These allow for the simplification of Maxwell’s four equations which define electromagnetism (aka.light) into a single equation.\n\nBelow is the first page of the comprehensive split octonion list of all 3840 Split Fano Planes with their multiplication tables available. _([8×16×30 Split Fano](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ad09e553-bdb2-4a8b-a310-428ad1c52d92\" alt=\"splitFano1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The split real even E8 group used has been determined from Dynkin diagram which builds the Cartan matrix and determines the root with corresponding Hasse diagrams.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The breaking chains of SO(10) to G SM are shown along with their terrestrial and cosmological signatures, where G x represents either G 3221 or G 421 .

This is not surprising, as N = 8 supergravity contains six independent representations of N = 4 super Yang–Mills.\n- The theory contains 1 [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) (spin 2), 8 [gravitinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitinos) (spin 3/2), 28 [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) (spin 1), 56 [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermions) (spin 1/2), 70 [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_fields) (spin 0) where we don't distinguish particles with negative spin.\n- These numbers are simple combinatorial numbers that come from [Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Triangle) and also the number of ways of writing n as a sum of 8 nonnegative cubes [A173681](https://oeis.org/A173681).\n- The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory and Higher-Spin Theories).

Similar issue is present in the usual Kaluza–Klein scenarios where one needs to provide a mechanism for _[spontaneous compactification](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure)_. We note, however, that the situation in theory (4) is somewhat better than in the usual KK setup. In the latter case, apart from the case of compactification on S1, the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions usually does not have solutions of the form of the product of Minkowski spacetime and (compact) internal manifolds. For this reason one usually extends the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions with extra fields, e.g. by considering the Einstein–Yang–Mills system. The stress–energy tensor of these extra fields then allows for solutions of the required product form, see e.g. [20], Section 3. Probably the most famous compactification mechanism is that due to Freund and Rubin [21], where the 3-form field of the 11D supergravity is doing the job. In contrast, the theory (4) admits the solution that is the S3 fibration over S4, see [14] for an explicit description. Thus, at least there is a solution of (4) of the desired type without having to introduce extra fields. However, the cosmological constant for the S3 fibration over S4 solution is too large, see [14]. This is similar to the situation with the Freund–Rubin solution. Thus, a compactification mechanism that would result in an appropriately small cosmological constant is a very serious open issue for our setup. It is possible that the only way forward is to add other fields. We then remark that there is a very natural extension of the theory (4) that adds forms of all odd degrees. This is the theory that appeared in [12], formula (29). It would be interesting to study 4D compactifications of this more general theory. We hope to analyse this in the future.\n- Another open problem of the present approach is that of coupling to matter. Again, a natural way to proceed is suggested by supergravity. One does not couple supergravity to extra fields, one simply studies what the modes already present become when viewed from the 4D perspective. In particular, when compactifying on a coset manifold all modes related to isometries of the internal space are known to be important. Indeed, recall that the gauge group that arises in the KK compactification is the group of isometries of the internal manifold, and its dimension may be larger than the dimension of the internal space itself. In this paper we have considered a compactification on a group manifold, but only retained half of the relevant isometries by considering the invariant dimensional reduction ansatz. It is clear that additional fields will arise by enlarging the ansatz by taking into account all the isometries. In this case, however, one must be careful about _[the issue of consistent truncation](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#undiscovered-features)_, see e.g. [22] for a clear description of all the issues arising. We leave a study of the dimensional reduction on S3 viewed as a coset S3 = SO(4)/SO(3) to future research.\n- Third, there is a question of how to describe Lorentzian signature metrics using this formalism. To do this one must make the 3-form C complex-valued, and then impose some appropriate reality conditions. Similar issues exist in all Plebanski-related formulations. We postpone their resolution to future work.\nFinally, to avoid confusion, we would like to say that our present use of G2 structures (3-forms in 7D) is different from what one can find in the literature on Kaluza–Klein compactifications of supergravity.\n\nIn our approach a 3-form is not an object that exist in addition to the metric — it is the only object that exist. The metric, and in particular the 4D metric, is defined by the 3-forvia (2). Also, in the supergravity context a 7D manifold with a G2 structure is used for compactifying the 11D supergravity down to 4D. In contrast, we compactify from 7D to 4D. _([General relativity from three-forms in seven dimensions - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14064088/1-s2.0-S0370269317304926-main.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/8/993\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ffcf7817-4cd8-4383-8bdc-abec8d07c948\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When describing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime\">spacetime</a> as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined\">well-defined</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">To define them, or make them unambiguous, a [continuum limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_limit) must carefully remove \"construction scaffolding\" of lattices at various scales.\n- Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values.

The exceptional [Jordan algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_algebra) has a representation in terms of 24×24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.\n- These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves \"exceptional\". For example, in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology), 8-fold real [Bott periodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bott_periodicity) can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_forms), the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [Dedekind eta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function) and the [modular discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_discriminant), which connection is deepened by [Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine), a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.\n\nIn [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena.

Despite this fact, I think that his theory deserves consideration so I will try to summarize it in the lines that follow.\n- The intervention of the Golden Ratio can be seen as a way to enter the quantum world, the world of subtle vibrations, in which we observe increasing energy levels as we move to smaller and smaller scales.\n- El Nachie has proposed a way of calculating the fractal dimension of quantum space-time.

Then:\n- While gluons may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of gluons in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by = 0 dG , and the invariance of F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While quarks may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by the invariance of P → P'= P under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface, there can indeed be a net flux of quark-antiquark pairs in to or out of any closed surface.\n- The antiquark cancels the quark, thereby averting a net flux, and in this way, quarks do flow in to or out of the closed surface, but only paired with antiquarks, as mesons.\n- This may possibly be represented as 02 ≠ i gG .\n- It does not matter how hard or in what manner one “smashes” a baryon, one can still never extract a net flux of quarks or a net flux of gluons, but only a large number of meson jets.\n- This may be possibly represented by the fact that in all of the foregoing, the volume and surface\nintegrals apply to any and all closed surfaces.\n- One can choose a small closed surface, a large closed surface, a spherical closed surface, an oblong closed surface, and indeed, a closed surface of any shape and size. The choice of closed surface does not matter.\n- These mathematical rules for what does and does not flow across any closed surface, in fact, thereby impose very stringent dynamical constraints on the behaviors of these non-Abelian magnetic sources: No matter what flows across various open surfaces, they may never be a net flux of anything across any closed\nsurface. The only exceptions, which may flow across a closed surface, are physical entities represented by.\n\nWhere is the author going with this?\n- The magnetic three-form P, and its associated third-rank antisymmetric tensorσµν P , has all\nthe characteristics of a baryon current density.\n- These σµν P , among their other properties, are naturally occurring sources containing exactly\nthree fermions. These constituent fermions are most-sensibly interpreted as quarks.\n- The surface symmetri F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of gluons across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The volume symmetry \u0001P → P'= P under F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of quarks across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The physical entities represented by 2 igG , when examined in further detail, have the\ncharacteristics of mesons.\n\n[![structure-of-composite-particles-l](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/2966004c-0c0d-4bca-85a9-1217d6b0237b)](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14322719/1711.10626.pdf)\n\nIt tells us that mesons are the only entities which may flow across any closed\nsurface of the baryon density. _([Lab Notes](https://jayryablon.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/lab-note-3-part-1-yang-mills-theory-the-origin-of-baryons-and-confinment-and-the-mass-gap/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14003298/qcd-confinement-handout-10.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223643996-1ea5cb89-324e-446c-9c9f-8c94c39909b3.png\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-ST-paradigm-a-is-never-directly-testable-too-small-Planck-length-scales-has-too_fig4_330474228\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220002045-d0395b21-1f2a-4dba-992a-24bf50c480d5.png\" alt=\"origin\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349356688_Singularity-free_stable_black_holes_holding_the_baryon_conservation_law_in_the_periodic_waveguided_multiverse\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84525042-2f67e080-ad05-11ea-9f9c-e07492446240.jpg\" alt=\"action\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Scientists believe there could be an <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a39745160/anti-universe-running-backward-in-time/\">anti-universe</a> somewhere out there that <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions\">acts like mirroring</a></em></strong> our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Only more accurate analysis on the involved spectra and on the relative brightness of the two rings, and mainly the discovery of other ***double rings systems***, could be used to finally choose which among these two interpretations is more likely to hold.

The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 &amp; 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).\n- Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].\n- Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of [Prime Spiral Sieve](https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve)) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.\n\nAnd when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing ***three (3) rotations*** around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. _([PrimesDemystified](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219261961-10e4d77f-ead3-43d4-9407-f01d83f1f204.png\" alt=\"Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These include generating variants of their abundance profile, assigning taxonomy and finally generating a rooted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\">phylogenetic tree</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#three-3-layers\">Standard Model</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Here is an elegant model to define the elementary particles of the Standard Model in Physics.\n- The black spheres are the bosons, the green ones leptons and the rest of the colored ones Murray Gell-Mann’s quarks (red for Generation I, blue for II and orange for III).\n- Higgs Boson (aka the God particle) that does not have charge is the vertex between the matter and anti-matter particles.\n- The z-boson and its counterpart would lie in the centroids of the tetrahedrons created by folding the triangles to meet up at the Higgs particle.\n\nThe next step is to re-gigg the model to account for the collisions and annihilations.

The A4HTM is a four-Higgs- Triplet-Model (δ of 1 and (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) of 3).\n- Four mass eigenstates of [doubly charged](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13276480_Higgs_triplets_in_the_standard_model) Higgs bosons, H±±i, are obtained explicitly from the Higgs potential.\n- We also obtained four mass eigenstates of the triplet-like singly charged Higgs bosons, H±T i, for which doublet components can be ignored because of small triplet vev’s.\n- It was shown that the A4HTM gives unique predictions about their decay branching ratios into two leptons (H−−i → ℓℓ′ and H−iT → ℓν); for example, the leptonic decays of H−−2 are only into µµ and eτ because an approximate Z3 symmetry remains, and the ratio of the branching ratios is 2 : 1 as a consequence of the A4 symmetry in the original Lagrangian.\n- Therefore, it will be possible to test the model at hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC) if some of these Higgs bosons are light enough to be produced.\n- Even if these Higgs bosons are too heavy to be produced at hadron colliders, they can affect the lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons if the triplet Yukawa coupling constants are large enough.\n- It was shown that there is no contribution of these Higgs bosonsto µ → eee ¯ and ℓ → ℓ′γ.\n- Thus, we can naturally expect signals of τ → µee and τ → eµµ(which are possible in this model among six τ → ℓℓ′ℓ′′) in the future in collider experiments (Super-KEKB, super B factory, super flavor factory, and LHCb) without interfering with a stringent experimental bound on µ → eee ¯ . This model will be excluded if ℓ → ℓ ′γ is observed.\n\nWe considered current experimental constraints on the model and prospects of the measurement of the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in the neutrino factory. If H±±2 or H±±3 is lighter enough than other H±±i, effects of the NSI can be around the expected sensitivity in the neutrino factory. _([Triplet Higgs bosons - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14442049/1005.5338.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://studylib.net/doc/5775531/phenomenology-of-the-higgs-triplet-model\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/e3b14f7a-bd2a-4dcc-b97f-30ad329458a0\" alt=\"how-we-can-constrain-various-higgs-sectors1-l\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Assigning a specific mass, length, time, and charge metrics based on new dimensional relationships and the Planck constant (<strong><em>which defines Higgs mass</em></strong>).</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The discovery of [neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation) indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete, but there is currently no clear evidence that nature is described by any _[Grand Unified Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory)_.

The light SU(2)L triplet Higgs required by the gauge coupling unification can be realized consistently within the framework of SU(5) grand unified theory (see Appendix B).\n- This complex triplet Higgs contains one CP-even Heavy Higgs, one CP-odd Higgs and two charged Higgs bosons, which could be the smoking gun single of this scenario.\n- Although the unification scale around 1014 GeV is too low, in the usual sense, leading to significant proton decay constraints, we have shown that the constrains can be avoided by introducing additional vector-like fermions which mix with the SM fermions through an SU(5) breaking mass term.\n- Importantly, the minimal requirement is quite simple and only requires the addition of a single pair of 10 and 10 fermions to mix with the first generation 10 matter multiplet.\n- To get enough suppression in the proton decay rate, the SU(2)L singlet quark should have significant mixing with the vector-like fermion while SU(2) doublet quark should have almost zero mixing with it (or vice versa).\n- Interestingly, this leads to a suppression in the proton decay mediated by X gauge bosons but leads to a significant enhancement in the proton decay through the colored Higgs boson. This means that if nature is realized by this minimal model, it is bound to show up in proton decay experiments eventually.\n- Although this model has some additional fine tuning, the fine-tuning of the fermion masses is similar in nature to the doublet-triplet splitting present in all GUT models. \n\nSince the fine-tuning for all the fields in our model, including the light complex SU(2)L triplet, are similar in design to the doublet-triplet splitting, it is possible that all the required tuning of this GUT theory is solved by a single lmechanism, e.g. product group unification scenarios. _([W boson mass anomaly and grand unification - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14412652/2205.03877.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>the 12 fermions and 5 bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">  Fermion  | spinors | charged | neutrinos |   quark   | components | parameter\n   Field   |   (s)   |   (c)   |    (n)    | (q=s.c.n) |  Σ(c+n+q   | (complex)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-1 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   19\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 17\nbispinor-2 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   i12 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-3 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   11\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 19\nbispinor-4 |    2    |    3    |     3     |    18     |     24     |   i18 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n  SubTotal |    8    |   12    |    12     |    72     |     96     |   66+i30\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nmajorana-1 |   2x2   |    -    |    18     |     -     |     18     |   18 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-2 |   2x2   |    -    |    12     |     -     |     12     |   12 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-3 |   2x2   |    -    |    13     |     -     |     13     |   i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n  SubTotal |    12   |    -    |    43     |     -     |     43     |  30+i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n     Total |    20   |   12    |    55     |    72     |    139     |  96+i43 ✔️\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>Since the total of parameters is <strong><em>66+i30</em></strong> then according to <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization\">renormalization theory</a></em> the 12 boson fields should have the total complex value of <strong><em>30+i66</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beyond-the-139\">Beyond the 139</h2>\n\n<p>Similarly the Standard Model incorporates three generations of quarks, so its fermionic content can be summarized.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In addition, the Standard Model involves gauge bosons (photons for the electromagnetic interaction, W and Z for the weak interaction, and ***eight (8) gluons*** for the strong interaction), plus the (scalar) Higgs particle.

This is on account of the overwhelmingly large background contribution from a number of other SM processes that can mimic its experimental signature characterized by the appearance of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark.\n\nThe CMS Collaboration overcame this challenge by deploying modern sophisticated analysis tools and by focusing on particular signatures where a Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson V (a W or Z particle), a weak interaction process known as VH(bb), shown in the figure below, leading to a significant reduction in the background. _([CERN](https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/36b73f3c-fc47-428e-9d90-7f6f1c1e361a\" alt=\"down-type quark\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Study of connections between neutrino phenomenology and leptogenesis shows the patterns of symmetry breaking from SO10 to the Standard Model gauge group.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Since right-handed neutrinos appear naturally in the grand unified model based on the group SO(10) [5], it is of interest to discuss leptogenesis under the constraints suggested by such a model.\n- It turns out, however, that such constraints render a successful leptogenesis extremely difficult to obtain.\n- This happens because, unless a fine tuning on the neutrino mass parameters is introduced, the right-handed neutrinos become very hierarchical in mass, with the lowest mass being too small to allow for leptogenesis. \n\nA compactness in the right-handed neutrino mass spectrum is, however, able to overcome this difficulty and achieve a consistent leptogenesis. _([Neutrino Phenomenology and Leptogenesis - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/fc850392-b83d-459d-9769-094843d447aa\" alt=\"Patterns-of-symmetry-breaking-from-SO10-to-the-Standard-Model-gauge-group\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We have found that if the intermediate scales induced by the soft SUSY breaking sector the model <strong><em>contains three families</em></strong> of vector-like leptons within the reach of LHC measurements or future High-Energy/High-Luminosity LHC upgrades.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Our framework features the minimum of three (and maximum of five) light Higgs doublets at the electroweak scale providing a Cabibbo mixing consistent with the top-charm and bottom-strange mass hierarchies as well as massless first-generation quarks at tree-level. _([Prospects for new physics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/220b1111-2b0e-454a-a56f-602de2a84afc\" alt=\"10052_2020_8710_Fig1_HTML\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of one-loop corrections with mild hierarchies supply the necessary ingredients to potentially generate realistic quark masses and mixing angles.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The present particle physics or standard model based on the \"unreal gauge transformation symmetry\" and meaningless math cannot explain any actual physical mechanism at all _([biglobe.ne.jp](https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/f351b6d2-753a-45e4-8e26-f06a822db06f\" alt=\"hsta1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Thus it appears that the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/#RSPA20200786C24\">cosmological models</a> derived from compactification of 11d supergravity on a manifold with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/\">G2 holonomy</a> have some <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups\">hidden E7 symmetry</a>.</em></strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-77-principles\">The 77 Principles</h2>\n\n<p>Using this concept we are going to stimulate a model of <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions\">the 11 dimensions</a> through the rank of their partition using github organizations of 13 repositories each.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">Each of the user profiles will have ***seven (7) user repositories*** consist of one (1) main of [`github.io`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and six (6) user pinned repositories.

Thus the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass provide a further impetus for the search for sparticles to continue at the current and future colliders.\n- The group SO(10) as the framework for grand unification appears preferred over SU(5). The group SO(10) contains both G(4, 2, 2) and SU(5)⊗U(1) as subgroups, i.e., SO(10) has the branchings SO(10) → SU(4)C ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ SU(2)R and SO(10) → SU(5) ⊗ U(1).[![Mystery of the First 1000 Prime Numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/225830554-007fbd06-9d7d-44e8-867d-c7b0188bf488.png)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)\n- ***It possesses a spinor representation which is 2⁵ = 32 dimensional and which splits into 16 ⊕ 16***. A full generation of quarks and leptons can be accommodated in a single 16 plet representation. Thus the 16 plet has the decomposition in SU(5) ⊗ U(1) so that 16 =10(−1) ⊕ 5(3) ⊕ 1(−5).\n- As noted the combination 5 ⊕ 10 in SU(5) is anomaly free and further 1(−5) in the 16-plet decomposition is a right handed neutrino which is a singlet of the standard model gauge group and thus the 16-plet of matter in SO(10) is anomaly free.\n- The absence of anomaly in this case is the consequence of a more general result for SO(N) gauge theories. Thus in general anomalies arise due to the non-vanishing of the trace over the product of three group generators in some given group representation Tr ({Ta, Tb}Tc).\n- For SO(10) one will have Tr ({Σµν, Σαβ}Σλρ). However, there is no invariant tensor to which the above quantity can be proportional which then automatically guarantees vanishing of the anomaly for SO(10). This analysis extends to other SO(N) groups.\n- ***One exception is SO(6) where there does exist a six index invariant tensor*** ǫµναβλρ and so in this case vanishing of the anomaly is not automatic.\n- The group SO(10) is rank 5 where as the standard model gauge group is rank 4. The rank of the group can be reduced by either using ***16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs fields or 126 ⊕ 126 of Higgs***.\n- Since under SU(5) ⊗ U(1) one has 16 ⊃ 1(−5) we see that a VEV formation for the singlet will reduce the rank of the group. Similarly 126 ⊃ 1(−10) under the above decomposition. Thus when the singlets in 16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs or 126 ⊕ 126 get VEVs, the SO(10) gauge symmetry will break reducing its rank.\n- However, we still need to reduce the remaining group symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group. For this we need to have additional Higgs fields such as 45, 54, 210. Further to get the residual gauge group SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em we need to have 10 -plet of Higgs fields.\n- Thus the breaking of SO(10) down to SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em ***requires at least three (3) sets of Higgs representations***: one to reduce the rank, the second to break the rest of the gauge group to the Standard Model gauge group and then at least one 10-plet to break the electroweak symmetry.[![Higgs fields](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ac0b2608-24b2-4a0d-bae8-55473a8576d9)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04892-x)\n- As discussed above one can do this by a combination of fields from the set: 10, 16 ⊕ 16, 45, 54, 120, 126 ⊕ 126, 210.\n- To generate quark and lepton masses we need to couple two 16-plets of matter with Higgs fields. ***To see which Higgs fields couple we expand the product 16⊗16 as a sum over the irreducible representations of SO(10)***. \n\nHere we have ***16 ⊗ 16 = 10s ⊕ 120a ⊕ 126s***, where the s(a) refer to symmetric (anti-symmetric) under the interchange of the two 16-plets. The array of Higgs bosons available lead to a large number of possible SO(10) models. _([Superunification - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14413665/1709.09718.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(10)\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/012168fa-d2d7-4b8d-a2af-280927eb4aae\" alt=\"SO(10)_-_16_Weight_Diagram svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Below is a powerful <a href=\"https://florianwinkler.at/the-standard-model-o\">cheat sheet</a> which is compiled to provide you with a great overview, not just stuffed with information, but also puts it in relation.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">I am pleased to announce the availability of [splitFano.pdf](https://theoryofeverything.org/TOE/JGM/splitFano.pdf), a 321 page pdf file with the 3840=480*8 [split octonion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion) permutations (with Fano planes and multiplication tables). \n- There are 30 canonical sets of 7 triads indexed with a Fano plane index (fpi) in (16). As in E8 with 16 of the 2⁸ = 256 binary representations excluded from the group, there are 32 excluded octonions from the 2⁹ = 512.\n- As in E8, excluded particles are associated with the color=0, generation=0 (bosons) which are the positive (and negative) generators commonly associated with the 8-orthoplex with 16 permutations of {±1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- These are organized into “flipped” and “non-flipped” pairs associated with the 240 assigned particles to E8 vertices (sorted by Fano plane index or fPi).\n- They are assigned to the [30 canonical sets of 7 triples](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14746885/E8toH4fold.pdf) using the maskList: {5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 3, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 6, 6, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 6}\n- There are 7 sets of split octonions for each of the 480 “parent” octonions (each of which is defined by 30 sets of 7 triads and 16 7 bit “sign masks” which reverse the direction of the triad multiplication). The 7 split octonions are identified by selecting a triad.\n- The complement of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and the triad list leaves 4 elements which are the rows/colums corresponding to the negated elements in the multiplication table (highlighted with yellow background).\n- The red arrows in the Fano Plane indicate the potential reversal due to this negation that defines the split octonions. The selected triad nodes are yellow, and the other 4 are cyan (25MB).\n- These allow for the simplification of Maxwell’s four equations which define electromagnetism (aka.light) into a single equation.\n\nBelow is the first page of the comprehensive split octonion list of all 3840 Split Fano Planes with their multiplication tables available. _([8×16×30 Split Fano](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/ad09e553-bdb2-4a8b-a310-428ad1c52d92\" alt=\"splitFano1\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The split real even E8 group used has been determined from Dynkin diagram which builds the Cartan matrix and determines the root with corresponding Hasse diagrams.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The breaking chains of SO(10) to G SM are shown along with their terrestrial and cosmological signatures, where G x represents either G 3221 or G 421 .

This is not surprising, as N = 8 supergravity contains six independent representations of N = 4 super Yang–Mills.\n- The theory contains 1 [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) (spin 2), 8 [gravitinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitinos) (spin 3/2), 28 [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) (spin 1), 56 [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermions) (spin 1/2), 70 [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_fields) (spin 0) where we don't distinguish particles with negative spin.\n- These numbers are simple combinatorial numbers that come from [Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Triangle) and also the number of ways of writing n as a sum of 8 nonnegative cubes [A173681](https://oeis.org/A173681).\n- The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory and Higher-Spin Theories).

GenI comprises a random walk process operating on a swarm-like construct and implements the competition among a finite set of ideas. Without any parameter tuning, GenI precisely fulfils the predictions of quantum measurements while its dynamics locally satisfy Einstein’s field equation. The model suggests, that the perceivable universe is evolving according to the collapse of its quantum state rather than a smoothly evolving wave function as widely believed in modern physics. ***Consequently, gravitation cannot be directly derived from quantum mechanics or vice versa***.

Even more annoyingly, both quantum mechanics and relativity are very solidly proven to be true.\n- Cosmologists found dark matter and then dark energy. They can describe their observed properties - point out that about 96% of everything is dark matter/energy - and then leave particle physicists with a major problem.\n- The demands of theoreticians for more data has pushed particle colliders to somewhere ***close to the limits of our ability*** to pay for the darned things (although not yet the limits of theoretical feasibility).\n- The construction of something significantly bigger than the Large Hadron Collider does not seem likely right now  so the data we have may turn out to be the only data we’ll ever have (from particle colliders). Large space telescopes, however, are getting MUCH better and when SpaceX get their StarShip to fly - they’ll be much cheaper and MUCH larger. So getting help from cosmologists MIGHT offer assistance.\n- The great hope that String Theory could be the “Theory of Everything” has somewhat tarnished. The last “Superstring revolution” was impressive but it was close to 30 years ago now and we still don’t seem to be adopting it as The Truth.\n- String theory predicts that one out of 10⁵ possible realities is the one we live in but fails to mention which one!

The Yukawa coupling is 10H 16f 16f. This includes a right-handed neutrino.\n\nIt has been long known that the SO(10) model is free from all perturbative local anomalies, computable by Feynman diagrams. However, it only became clear in 2018 that the SO(10) model is also free from all [nonperturbative global anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(physics)#Witten_anomaly_and_Wang-Wen-Witten_anomaly) on [non-spin manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure) --- an important rule for confirming the consistency of SO(10) grand unified theory, with a Spin(10) gauge group and chiral fermions in the 16-dimensional spinor representations, defined on non-spin manifolds. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(10)))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<table>\n <thead>\n <tr>\n <th>Syntax</th>\n <th>Description</th>\n <th>Last</th>\n </tr>\n </thead>\n <tbody>\n <tr>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/69668b65-0dae-41c1-b9a4-f4ff5dd67aa4\" alt=\"download (3)\" /></td>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b15fab38-3ac0-4f11-9824-d995ab9aa5fe\" alt=\"download (4)\" /></td>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a4c1a97b-6580-4889-bd37-abe72ce5a294\" alt=\"download (2)\" /></td>\n </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>In the spin-foam formalism, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett%E2%80%93Crane_model\">Barrett–Crane model</a>, which was for a while the most promising state-sum model of 4D Lorentzian quantum gravity</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">It was [based on representations](https://www.eq19.com/addition/5.html#power-of-magnitude) of the noncompact groups SO(3,1) or SL(2,C), so the spin foam faces (and hence the spin network edges) were labelled by positive real numbers as opposed to the half-integer labels of SU(2) spin networks. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_invariance_in_loop_quantum_gravity))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2013-3\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/561fe8cb-65f6-4050-ab54-3b45392ac897\" alt=\"41114_2016_3_Equ168\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/db04e836-0f19-48a1-8f1f-cc48c9a52a1b\" alt=\"41114_2016_3_Equ115\" /></p>\n\n<p>The field content of this theory is the massless N = 8 supergravity which comprises the graviton, 8 gravitinos, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_%3D_8_supergravity\">28 vector fields</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In four spacetime dimensions, N = 8 supergravity, speculated by [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking), is the most [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric) quantum field theory which ***involves gravity*** and a finite number of fields.\n- It can be found from a [dimensional reduction](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups) of 11D supergravity ***by making the size of seven (7) of the dimensions go to zero***.\n- ***It has eight (8) supersymmetries***, which is the most any gravitational theory can have, since there are eight half-steps between spin 2 and spin −2.

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

So a standard [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.\n- Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)) onto the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)): ***\"left\" is negative, \"right\" is positive.\nhave mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames***.\n- Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/70cb2eb0-0955-4d18-8400-e05ac1b9d325\" alt=\"Symmetry State\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Standard Model with massive neutrinos need <strong><em>7 more parameters</em></strong> (3 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo%E2%80%93Kobayashi%E2%80%93Maskawa_matrix\">CKM</a> and 4 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMNS_matrix\">PMNS matrix</a> parameters) for a total of <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/15.html#parity-order\">26 parameters</a></em>.

In particular, its connection with fundamental, string-model independent, axion fields associated with the massless gravitational multiplet of the string are discussed.\n- It is argued in favour of the role of primordial gravitational anomalies coupled to such axions in inducing inflation of a type encountered in the ***Running-Vacuum-Model (RVM)*** cosmological framework, without fundamental inflaton fields.[![Torsion in String Cosmologies](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a1cb4596-ff53-46bc-9da3-af9420603b35)\n](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14230039/Torsion_in_String-Inspired_Cosmologies_and_the_Uni.pdf)\n- The gravitational-anomaly terms owe their existence to the Green–Schwarz mechanism for the (extra-dimensional) anomaly cancellation, and may be non-trivial in such theories in ***the presence of (primordial) gravitational waves at early stages of the four (4) dimensional string universe (after compactification)***.[![triangular wave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/225824209-ba2b9fe0-1a29-4208-940e-3351243ab0ba.png)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)\n- The paper also discusses how the torsion-induced stringy axions can acquire a mass in the post inflationary era, due to non-perturbative effects, thus having the potential to play the role of (a component of) dark matter in such models.\n\nFinally, the current-era phenomenology of this model is briefly described with emphasis placed on the possibility of alleviating tensions observed in the current-era cosmological data.

In nonrenormalizable effective field theory, terms in the Lagrangian do multiply to infinity, but have coefficients suppressed by ever-more-extreme inverse powers of the energy cutoff.![169-over-109-blood-pressure](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a702ea20-2ef3-424f-804e-c73a6c873692)\n- If the cutoff is a real, physical quantity—that is, if the theory is only an effective description of physics up to some maximum energy or minimum distance scale—then these additional terms could represent real physical interactions.\n- Assuming that the dimensionless constants in the theory do not get too large, one can group calculations by inverse powers of the cutoff, and extract approximate predictions to finite order in the cutoff that still have a finite number of free parameters. It can even be useful to renormalize these \"nonrenormalizable\" interactions.[![multiplication zones](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/195963923-0796217c-7a87-4b2d-ba93-f47465304c03.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)\n- Nonrenormalizable interactions in effective field theories rapidly become weaker as the energy scale becomes much smaller than the cutoff.

A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 &lt; m2 &lt; m3) or not. Now that m1 &lt; m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 &lt; m1 &lt; m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy. In the lepton sector, however, none of the CP-violating phases has been measured.  _([Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing Puzzles - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14159651/1411.2713.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quark-Mass-Hierarchy-and-Flavor-Mixing-Puzzles-Xing/3719fec87f5e50c70eada23057b4b48fb5de4f18\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/44758746-c069-4fb6-a2e9-8574d2d63b29\" alt=\"CKM vs PMNS\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong><em>3x3 lepton vs quark</em></strong> mixing matrices appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the <strong><em>PMNS matrix U</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>CKM matrix V</em></strong>, which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Muons are about ***200 times heavier*** than the electron.

Then:\n- While gluons may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of gluons in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by = 0 dG , and the invariance of F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While quarks may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by the invariance of P → P'= P under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface, there can indeed be a net flux of quark-antiquark pairs in to or out of any closed surface.\n- The antiquark cancels the quark, thereby averting a net flux, and in this way, quarks do flow in to or out of the closed surface, but only paired with antiquarks, as mesons.\n- This may possibly be represented as 02 ≠ i gG .\n- It does not matter how hard or in what manner one “smashes” a baryon, one can still never extract a net flux of quarks or a net flux of gluons, but only a large number of meson jets.\n- This may be possibly represented by the fact that in all of the foregoing, the volume and surface\nintegrals apply to any and all closed surfaces.\n- One can choose a small closed surface, a large closed surface, a spherical closed surface, an oblong closed surface, and indeed, a closed surface of any shape and size. The choice of closed surface does not matter.\n- These mathematical rules for what does and does not flow across any closed surface, in fact, thereby impose very stringent dynamical constraints on the behaviors of these non-Abelian magnetic sources: No matter what flows across various open surfaces, they may never be a net flux of anything across any closed\nsurface. The only exceptions, which may flow across a closed surface, are physical entities represented by.\n\nWhere is the author going with this?\n- The magnetic three-form P, and its associated third-rank antisymmetric tensorσµν P , has all\nthe characteristics of a baryon current density.\n- These σµν P , among their other properties, are naturally occurring sources containing exactly\nthree fermions. These constituent fermions are most-sensibly interpreted as quarks.\n- The surface symmetri F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of gluons across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The volume symmetry \u0001P → P'= P under F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of quarks across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The physical entities represented by 2 igG , when examined in further detail, have the\ncharacteristics of mesons.\n\n[![structure-of-composite-particles-l](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/2966004c-0c0d-4bca-85a9-1217d6b0237b)](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14322719/1711.10626.pdf)\n\nIt tells us that mesons are the only entities which may flow across any closed\nsurface of the baryon density. _([Lab Notes](https://jayryablon.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/lab-note-3-part-1-yang-mills-theory-the-origin-of-baryons-and-confinment-and-the-mass-gap/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14003298/qcd-confinement-handout-10.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223643996-1ea5cb89-324e-446c-9c9f-8c94c39909b3.png\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-ST-paradigm-a-is-never-directly-testable-too-small-Planck-length-scales-has-too_fig4_330474228\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220002045-d0395b21-1f2a-4dba-992a-24bf50c480d5.png\" alt=\"origin\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349356688_Singularity-free_stable_black_holes_holding_the_baryon_conservation_law_in_the_periodic_waveguided_multiverse\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84525042-2f67e080-ad05-11ea-9f9c-e07492446240.jpg\" alt=\"action\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Scientists believe there could be an <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a39745160/anti-universe-running-backward-in-time/\">anti-universe</a> somewhere out there that <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions\">acts like mirroring</a></em></strong> our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Only more accurate analysis on the involved spectra and on the relative brightness of the two rings, and mainly the discovery of other ***double rings systems***, could be used to finally choose which among these two interpretations is more likely to hold.

The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 &amp; 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's.

The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.\n\nMany of these problems apply to LQG, including:\n\n- Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?\n- Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete?\n- Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)?\n- Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory?\n\nThe theory of LQG is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity, as is [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory). There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory), the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/46fed45e-a52b-4456-9aad-d995a69b01d4\" alt=\"Loop Quantum Gravity\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These loops shall generate <strong>1000 XML sitemaps</strong> lead by π(1+1000/Φ) = π(1+618) = 114 objects where 37 of these objects are inventing the <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-27-parameters\">27 patterns</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The 'Grid Square' Crop Circle is one of the most significant mathematical formations \n- Numbers 65 and 325 have reciprocal (1/x) or we can call them wave values that link to certain expressions of electromagnetism. 1/65= .0[153846...] and 1/325= .00[307692...]  are period 6 repeat decimals (digital root 9) that reveal other numbers of significance: ***27, 37 &amp; triple digits***.![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72742512-76c9c500-3bdc-11ea-8938-99864c3a8435.jpg)\n- The math of the 'Grid Square' crop circle gives the value of 153846... and when added to another number in the design, close approximations to √5 and Ф can be made.  \n- Dividing numbers with digital roots of 3,6,9 by 19.5 also creates these same two number patterns. 19.5 can be seen as 195, a multiple of 65. 19.47° (19.5) is the latitude in which planetary energy is said to upwell. 27 is also connected to the tetrahedron and the tetrahedron is connected to 19.5 degree\n- A star tetrahedron nested in a sphere touches at 19.47° north and south latitude. 19.47° has also been noted in the geometry of crop circles and angles connecting them to one another and to sacred sites.\n- Dividing integers by 13 (a star prime) creates the same two patterns. 13 is a factor of 65: 1, 65, 5-- 3rd prime,13--6th prime.\n- VBM polarity pairings are also made every 1st/4th, 2nd/5th, 3rd/6th number. \n- Interestingly, the wave value for 7 (1/7= .142857...) connects perfectly with these two patterns--153846 + 142857 = 296703--- the mirror number to 307692. ***All 3 patterns total 27 and 27 is also a factor of all***.[![27 patterns in 6 dimensions](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/c386f52e-d94c-4fd7-9f73-46ce7aaa0a05)](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-712X/6/1/8)\n- Because of factor 37, many triple digits are factors: 111, 222, 333, 666, 777, 999 | 142+857= 999 | 153+846= 999 | 307+692= 999\n\nThe 37 and 73 are both Star numbers, both have the same shape, but with different Hexagon portions.

They found many wonderful things.\n- For one, a CPT-respecting ***universe naturally expands and fills itself with particles, without the need for a long-theorized period of rapid expansion known as inflation***. While there's a lot of evidence that an event like inflation occurred, the theoretical picture of that event is incredibly fuzzy. It's so fuzzy that there is plenty of room for proposals of viable alternatives.\n- Second, a CPT-respecting universe would add some additional neutrinos to the mix. There are three known neutrino flavors: the electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrino. ***Strangely, all three of these neutrino flavors are left-handed*** (referring to the direction of its spin relative to its motion). All other particles known to physics have both left- and right-handed varieties, so physicists have long wondered if there are additional right-handed neutrinos.\n- A CPT-respecting universe would demand the existence of ***at least one right-handed neutrino species***.

But an invisible particle that floods the universe and only interacts via gravity sounds a lot like dark matter.\n\nThe researchers found that the conditions imposed by obeying CPT symmetry would fill our universe with right-handed neutrinos, enough to account for the dark matter. _([LiveScience](https://www.livescience.com/mirror-universe-explains-dark-matter))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><strong><em>1 instance + 7 blocks + 29 flats + 77 rooms = 37+77 = 114 objects</em></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n     |    168    |    618    |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+     -----------------------------------------------\n{786}| 1,2 |  2  | 2,3 | 3,4 | {19}                                          |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                                               |\n {86}|  4  | 4,5 | 5,6 |{6,7}| 17                                        Base Zone\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+                                               |\n {78}|{7,8}| 8,9 | 12 (M &amp; F) ----&gt; Δ                                        |\n     +-----+-----+-----+  &lt;--------   Mirror Zone (Middle zero axis)   -----------\n {67}| 9,11|11,12|12,14| 11                                                  |\n ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+                                               |\n  {6}|15,16|17,18|18,20|21,22| 19                                    Extended Zone\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+                                               |\n  {8}|23,25|25,27|27,29| 18                                                  |\n     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+         -----------\n  {7}|29,33|33,36|36,39|39,41|41,45|46,51|51,57|58,66|{67,77}| 43 (C1 &amp; C2)&lt;---Δ\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+         -----------\n     |  1     2     3  |   4     5     6 |   7     8      9  |\n     |------ 29' ------|--------------- 139' ----------------|\n     |------ 618¨ -----|--------------- 168¨ ----------------| ✔️\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>This <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-77-principles\">77 principles</a></em> have worked so well on simple examples such as water molecules that we can be reasonably confident they will work for more complex examples.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">MEC 30 claims to \"illustrate and convey the connections between quantum mechanics, gravitation and mathematics in a new way\" via the elementary level of numbers.\n\n**[Why does it work?](https://youtu.be/jeyQZyGCnqM)**\n\n- It starts with a theory about the structure of light, which is then transferred to various areas of the natural sciences.\n- In the subatomic space, Heisenberger does not allow precise measurements because the measurements themselves distort the result.\n- Through the mathematical basis presented here, our scale behaves like _[Plank's quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law)_ of action and shows in the positions the behaviorally entangled photons, which in turn produce the quantum of action in the sums. \n- The MEC 30 as a folding rule is also here a tool for _[The Entangled Quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement)_ systems to explain the ghostly behavior of _[the elementary particles](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#elementary-particles)_.\n- It would also to make the underlying algorithm visible and explainable, keyword quantum teleportation.

Without any parameter tuning, GenI precisely fulfils the predictions of quantum measurements while its dynamics locally satisfy Einstein’s field equation. The model suggests, that the perceivable universe is evolving according to the collapse of its quantum state rather than a smoothly evolving wave function as widely believed in modern physics. ***Consequently, gravitation cannot be directly derived from quantum mechanics or vice versa***.

Even more annoyingly, both quantum mechanics and relativity are very solidly proven to be true.\n- Cosmologists found dark matter and then dark energy. They can describe their observed properties - point out that about 96% of everything is dark matter/energy - and then leave particle physicists with a major problem.\n- The demands of theoreticians for more data has pushed particle colliders to somewhere ***close to the limits of our ability*** to pay for the darned things (although not yet the limits of theoretical feasibility).\n- The construction of something significantly bigger than the Large Hadron Collider does not seem likely right now  so the data we have may turn out to be the only data we’ll ever have (from particle colliders). Large space telescopes, however, are getting MUCH better and when SpaceX get their StarShip to fly - they’ll be much cheaper and MUCH larger. So getting help from cosmologists MIGHT offer assistance.\n- The great hope that String Theory could be the “Theory of Everything” has somewhat tarnished. The last “Superstring revolution” was impressive but it was close to 30 years ago now and we still don’t seem to be adopting it as The Truth.\n- String theory predicts that one out of 10⁵ possible realities is the one we live in but fails to mention which one! This is not exactly useful!\n- Current string theories seem ***incompatible with dark energy*** - which is definitely not good.\n\nThere is an additional problem called ***Background Independence*** - which is a property that Relativity requires - but which string theory does not seem to reproduce… but this is still a matter of contention. (I confess I do not understand what “Background Independence” actually is… but I Am Not A Theoretical Physicist.) _([Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-the-theory-of-everything/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=15&amp;oid=1477743656568813&amp;share=49865320&amp;srid=Yz5Fe&amp;target_type=answer))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://nitinuchil.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/hypercomplex-math/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/7f33f268-8464-4273-bcb0-aa26f1aaff21\" alt=\"elementary particles\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>In the next section we will discuss about building the algorithms to find a solution in physics and their <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/\">relation</a> to the distribution of prime numbers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"three-3-layers\">Three (3) Layers</h2>\n\n<p>Our scenario of <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/#prime-identity\">prime identity</a> is layering three (3) prime pairs out of the symmetrical behaviour of 36 as the smallest number (greater than 1) which is not a prime.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-tip\">By our project this prime layering is called _[The True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/2.html)_ and to be intrepeted as: Mapping the quantum way within a huge of primes objects (5 to 19) by lexering (11) the ungrammared feed (7) and parsering (13) across syntax (17).\n</code></pre>  \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-txt\">$True Prime Pairs:\n (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n \n layer|  i  |   f\n -----+-----+---------\n      |  1  | 5\n   1  +-----+\n      |  2  | 7\n -----+-----+---  } 36 » 6®\n      |  3  | 11\n   2  +-----+\n      |  4  | 13\n -----+-----+---------\n      |  5  | 17\n   3  +-----+     } 36 » 6®\n      |  6  | 19\n -----+-----+---------\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p>The (3) layers represents generation in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model\">Standard Model</a> of flavor that counts <strong><em>six (6) flavours of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark\">quarks</a></em></strong> and <strong><em>six (6) flavours of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton\">leptons</a></em></strong>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Leptons may be assigned the six flavour quantum numbers: electron number, muon number, tau number, and corresponding numbers for the neutrinos.\n- These are conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but violated by weak interactions. \n- Therefore, such flavour quantum numbers are not of great use.

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

It is negative (\"left-handed\") if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.\n- Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)) onto the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)): ***\"left\" is negative, \"right\" is positive.\nhave mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames***.\n- Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory.

A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 &lt; m2 &lt; m3) or not. Now that m1 &lt; m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 &lt; m1 &lt; m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy. In the lepton sector, however, none of the CP-violating phases has been measured.  _([Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing Puzzles - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14159651/1411.2713.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quark-Mass-Hierarchy-and-Flavor-Mixing-Puzzles-Xing/3719fec87f5e50c70eada23057b4b48fb5de4f18\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/44758746-c069-4fb6-a2e9-8574d2d63b29\" alt=\"CKM vs PMNS\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The <strong><em>3x3 lepton vs quark</em></strong> mixing matrices appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the <strong><em>PMNS matrix U</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>CKM matrix V</em></strong>, which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Muons are about ***200 times heavier*** than the electron.

Then:\n- While gluons may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of gluons in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by = 0 dG , and the invariance of F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While quarks may flow within the closed surface across various open surfaces, there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface.\n- This may possibly be represented by the invariance of P → P'= P under the transformation F → F'= F − dG .\n- While there can be no net flux of individual quarks in to or out of any closed surface, there can indeed be a net flux of quark-antiquark pairs in to or out of any closed surface.\n- The antiquark cancels the quark, thereby averting a net flux, and in this way, quarks do flow in to or out of the closed surface, but only paired with antiquarks, as mesons.\n- This may possibly be represented as 02 ≠ i gG .\n- It does not matter how hard or in what manner one “smashes” a baryon, one can still never extract a net flux of quarks or a net flux of gluons, but only a large number of meson jets.\n- This may be possibly represented by the fact that in all of the foregoing, the volume and surface\nintegrals apply to any and all closed surfaces.\n- One can choose a small closed surface, a large closed surface, a spherical closed surface, an oblong closed surface, and indeed, a closed surface of any shape and size. The choice of closed surface does not matter.\n- These mathematical rules for what does and does not flow across any closed surface, in fact, thereby impose very stringent dynamical constraints on the behaviors of these non-Abelian magnetic sources: No matter what flows across various open surfaces, they may never be a net flux of anything across any closed\nsurface. The only exceptions, which may flow across a closed surface, are physical entities represented by.\n\nWhere is the author going with this?\n- The magnetic three-form P, and its associated third-rank antisymmetric tensorσµν P , has all\nthe characteristics of a baryon current density.\n- These σµν P , among their other properties, are naturally occurring sources containing exactly\nthree fermions. These constituent fermions are most-sensibly interpreted as quarks.\n- The surface symmetri F → F' = F under the transformation F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of gluons across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The volume symmetry \u0001P → P'= P under F → F'= F − dG , tells us that there is no net flow of quarks across any closed surface over the baryon density.\n- The physical entities represented by 2 igG , when examined in further detail, have the\ncharacteristics of mesons.\n\n[![structure-of-composite-particles-l](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/2966004c-0c0d-4bca-85a9-1217d6b0237b)](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14322719/1711.10626.pdf)\n\nIt tells us that mesons are the only entities which may flow across any closed\nsurface of the baryon density. _([Lab Notes](https://jayryablon.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/lab-note-3-part-1-yang-mills-theory-the-origin-of-baryons-and-confinment-and-the-mass-gap/))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14003298/qcd-confinement-handout-10.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/223643996-1ea5cb89-324e-446c-9c9f-8c94c39909b3.png\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-ST-paradigm-a-is-never-directly-testable-too-small-Planck-length-scales-has-too_fig4_330474228\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220002045-d0395b21-1f2a-4dba-992a-24bf50c480d5.png\" alt=\"origin\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349356688_Singularity-free_stable_black_holes_holding_the_baryon_conservation_law_in_the_periodic_waveguided_multiverse\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/84525042-2f67e080-ad05-11ea-9f9c-e07492446240.jpg\" alt=\"action\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Scientists believe there could be an <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a39745160/anti-universe-running-backward-in-time/\">anti-universe</a> somewhere out there that <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions\">acts like mirroring</a></em></strong> our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Only more accurate analysis on the involved spectra and on the relative brightness of the two rings, and mainly the discovery of other ***double rings systems***, could be used to finally choose which among these two interpretations is more likely to hold.

The report[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton#cite_note-Abbott2017-22) did not elaborate on the source of this ratio. \n\n***It is possible that gravitons are not the quanta of gravitational waves, or that the two phenomena are related in a different way***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dark-energy-map-gives-clue-about-what-it-is-but-deepens-dispute-about-the-cosmic-expansion-rate-143200\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220039299-b3439ba6-8479-4a72-9521-bc12b5651e85.png\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There even stated by the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology\">conformal cyclic cosmology</a></em> that this hypothesis requires that all massive particles eventually vanish from existence.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">As Penrose points out, [proton decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay) is a possibility contemplated in various speculative extensions of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), but it has never been observed. _Moreover, all [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) must also decay, or lose their charge and/or mass, and no conventional speculations allow for this_.\n\nIn his Nobel Prize Lecture video, Roger Penrose moderated his previous requirement for no mass, beginning at 26:30 in the video, allowing some mass particles to be present as long as the amounts are insignificant with nearly all of their energy being kinetic, and in a conformal geometry dominated by photons. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/8707fac0-67fe-4a17-88ef-eeff907a925d\" alt=\"conformal cyclic cosmology\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This is because all second and third generation particles are <strong><em>unstable and quickly decay</em></strong> into stable first generation particles.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The Prime Spiral Sieve possesses remarkable structural and numeric symmetries.\n- For starters, the intervals between the prime roots (and every subsequent row or rotation of the sieve) are ***perfectly balanced***, with a period 8 difference sequence of: {6, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2}. The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 &amp; 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).\n- Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].\n- Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of [Prime Spiral Sieve](https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve)) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.\n\nAnd when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing ***three (3) rotations*** around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. _([PrimesDemystified](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219261961-10e4d77f-ead3-43d4-9407-f01d83f1f204.png\" alt=\"Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These include generating variants of their abundance profile, assigning taxonomy and finally generating a rooted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree\">phylogenetic tree</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#three-3-layers\">Standard Model</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">Here is an elegant model to define the elementary particles of the Standard Model in Physics.\n- The black spheres are the bosons, the green ones leptons and the rest of the colored ones Murray Gell-Mann’s quarks (red for Generation I, blue for II and orange for III).\n- Higgs Boson (aka the God particle) that does not have charge is the vertex between the matter and anti-matter particles.\n- The z-boson and its counterpart would lie in the centroids of the tetrahedrons created by folding the triangles to meet up at the Higgs particle.\n\nThe next step is to re-gigg the model to account for the collisions and annihilations.

The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.\n\nMany of these problems apply to LQG, including:\n\n- Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?\n- Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete?\n- Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)?\n- Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory?\n\nThe theory of LQG is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity, as is [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory). There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory), the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction.\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/46fed45e-a52b-4456-9aad-d995a69b01d4\" alt=\"Loop Quantum Gravity\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These loops shall generate <strong>1000 XML sitemaps</strong> lead by π(1+1000/Φ) = π(1+618) = 114 objects where 37 of these objects are inventing the <em><a href=\"https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-27-parameters\">27 patterns</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">The 'Grid Square' Crop Circle is one of the most significant mathematical formations \n- Numbers 65 and 325 have reciprocal (1/x) or we can call them wave values that link to certain expressions of electromagnetism. 1/65= .0[153846...] and 1/325= .00[307692...]  are period 6 repeat decimals (digital root 9) that reveal other numbers of significance: ***27, 37 &amp; triple digits***.![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/72742512-76c9c500-3bdc-11ea-8938-99864c3a8435.jpg)\n- The math of the 'Grid Square' crop circle gives the value of 153846... and when added to another number in the design, close approximations to √5 and Ф can be made.  \n- Dividing numbers with digital roots of 3,6,9 by 19.5 also creates these same two number patterns. 19.5 can be seen as 195, a multiple of 65. 19.47° (19.5) is the latitude in which planetary energy is said to upwell. 27 is also connected to the tetrahedron and the tetrahedron is connected to 19.5 degree\n- A star tetrahedron nested in a sphere touches at 19.47° north and south latitude. 19.47° has also been noted in the geometry of crop circles and angles connecting them to one another and to sacred sites.\n- Dividing integers by 13 (a star prime) creates the same two patterns. 13 is a factor of 65: 1, 65, 5-- 3rd prime,13--6th prime.\n- VBM polarity pairings are also made every 1st/4th, 2nd/5th, 3rd/6th number. \n- Interestingly, the wave value for 7 (1/7= .142857...) connects perfectly with these two patterns--153846 + 142857 = 296703--- the mirror number to 307692. ***All 3 patterns total 27 and 27 is also a factor of all***.[![27 patterns in 6 dimensions](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/c386f52e-d94c-4fd7-9f73-46ce7aaa0a05)](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-712X/6/1/8)\n- Because of factor 37, many triple digits are factors: 111, 222, 333, 666, 777, 999 | 142+857= 999 | 153+846= 999 | 307+692= 999\n\nThe 37 and 73 are both Star numbers, both have the same shape, but with different Hexagon portions.

In addition to Standard Model particles, the theory includes 30 colored X bosons, responsible for [proton decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay), and two W' bosons.\n- Right: The pattern of charges for particles in the SO(10) model, rotated to show the embedding in [E6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E6_(mathematics)).\n- The matter representations come in three copies (generations) of the 16 representation. The Yukawa coupling is 10H 16f 16f. This includes a right-handed neutrino.\n\nIt has been long known that the SO(10) model is free from all perturbative local anomalies, computable by Feynman diagrams. However, it only became clear in 2018 that the SO(10) model is also free from all [nonperturbative global anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(physics)#Witten_anomaly_and_Wang-Wen-Witten_anomaly) on [non-spin manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure) --- an important rule for confirming the consistency of SO(10) grand unified theory, with a Spin(10) gauge group and chiral fermions in the 16-dimensional spinor representations, defined on non-spin manifolds. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO(10)))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<table>\n <thead>\n <tr>\n <th>Syntax</th>\n <th>Description</th>\n <th>Last</th>\n </tr>\n </thead>\n <tbody>\n <tr>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/69668b65-0dae-41c1-b9a4-f4ff5dd67aa4\" alt=\"download (3)\" /></td>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/b15fab38-3ac0-4f11-9824-d995ab9aa5fe\" alt=\"download (4)\" /></td>\n <td><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/a4c1a97b-6580-4889-bd37-abe72ce5a294\" alt=\"download (2)\" /></td>\n </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>In the spin-foam formalism, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett%E2%80%93Crane_model\">Barrett–Crane model</a>, which was for a while the most promising state-sum model of 4D Lorentzian quantum gravity</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">It was [based on representations](https://www.eq19.com/addition/5.html#power-of-magnitude) of the noncompact groups SO(3,1) or SL(2,C), so the spin foam faces (and hence the spin network edges) were labelled by positive real numbers as opposed to the half-integer labels of SU(2) spin networks. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_invariance_in_loop_quantum_gravity))_\n</code></pre>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2013-3\"><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/561fe8cb-65f6-4050-ab54-3b45392ac897\" alt=\"41114_2016_3_Equ168\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/db04e836-0f19-48a1-8f1f-cc48c9a52a1b\" alt=\"41114_2016_3_Equ115\" /></p>\n\n<p>The field content of this theory is the massless N = 8 supergravity which comprises the graviton, 8 gravitinos, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_%3D_8_supergravity\">28 vector fields</a></em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">In four spacetime dimensions, N = 8 supergravity, speculated by [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking), is the most [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric) quantum field theory which ***involves gravity*** and a finite number of fields.\n- It can be found from a [dimensional reduction](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups) of 11D supergravity ***by making the size of seven (7) of the dimensions go to zero***.\n- ***It has eight (8) supersymmetries***, which is the most any gravitational theory can have, since there are eight half-steps between spin 2 and spin −2.
